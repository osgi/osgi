    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Eventing systems are a common part of software programs, used to 
    distribute information between parts of an application. To address this
    the <xref linkend="service.event"/> was created as one of the earliest 
    specifications defined by the OSGi Compendium. The design and usage of 
    the Event Admin specification, however, makes certain trade-offs that do 
    not fit well with modern application design:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Type Safety</emphasis> - Events are sent and received 
        as opaque maps of key-value pairs. The “schema” of an event is therefore 
        ill-defined and relies on “magic strings” being used correctly to locate 
        data, and on careful handling of data values with unknown types.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Unhandled Events</emphasis> - Events that are sent but have 
        no interested Event Consumers are silently discarded. There is no way to know 
        that an event was not handled, short of disrupting the system by registering
        a handler for <emphasis>all</emphasis> events.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Observability</emphasis> - There is no simple, non-invasive 
        way to monitor the flow of events through the system. The ability to monitor
        and profile applications using Event Admin is therefore relatively limited.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Adding these features to the original <xref linkend="service.event"/> 
    specification is not feasible without breaking backward compatibility for clients.
    Therefore this specification exists to provide an alternative eventing model which
    supports these different requirements by making different design trade-offs.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Events</title>
    
    <para>In this specification an Event is a set of string keys associated with data values. 
    The defined set of allowable keys and permitted value types for the keys in an 
    Event is known as the Event Schema. Both the Event Source and Event Consumers must
    agree on a schema (or set of compatible schemas) in order for events to be consumed
    correctly.</para>
  
    
    <section>
      <title>Type Safe Events</title>
      
      <para>A Type Safe Event is one in which the Event Schema is defined as a Java class. Using
      a Java class provides a formal definition of the schema - event data uses fields in the class
      as the keys, and each field definition defines the permitted type of the value.</para>
      
      <remark>TODO: should we also support record types?</remark>
      
      <para>Type Safe Event classes are expected to conform to OSGi DTO rules. The architecture of 
      OSGi DTOs is described in <xref linkend="intro.core.release" xrefstyle="template:%t"/>. All 
      methods, all static fields, and any non public instance fields of an event object must be 
      ignored by the Typed Event Service when processing the Event data.</para>
      
      <section>
        <title>Nested Data Structures</title>
        <para>OSGi DTOs are permitted to have data values which are also DTOs, allowing nested data
        structures to be created. This is also allowed for Type Safe Events, but with the same 
        restriction that the event data must be a tree. There is no restriction on the depth of
        nesting permitted.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Untyped Events</title>
      
      <para>An Untyped Event is one in which there is no Java class defining the Event Schema.
      In this case the event data is defined using a <code>Map</code> type with <code>String</code>
      keys and values limited to types acceptable as fields in a DTO, excepting:</para>
      
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>DTO types - an untyped event may not have DTOs inside it as these form
          part of a typed schema</para>
        </listitem>
        
        <listitem>
          <para>Maps are only permitted if they follow the rules for Untyped events, that is having
          <code>String</code> keys and DTO restricted value types excluding DTOs.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>       
     
      <para>Untyped Event instances are capable of representing exactly the same data as present
      in a Type Safe Event instance, and are also subject to the same restrictions, that is 
      the data must be a tree. Nested data should be included as sub-maps within the event map,
      and these sub-maps may in turn contain nested data.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Non Standard Type Safe Events</title>
        
      <para>Some Event schemas may be represented by an existing type which does not match the 
      OSGi DTO rules. In this case there are two main options:</para>
        
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Create a DTO representation of the event schema, and convert from the existing 
          type into the DTO representation in code.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Convert the event data into an Untyped Event representation using nested Maps.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      
      <para>For example, the following code demonstrates how an object following the JavaBeans 
      pattern can be converted into a DTO type or an untyped map:</para>
      
      <programlisting>public class ExampleJavaBean {
    private String message;
    
    public String getMessage() { return message; }

    public void setMessage(String message) { this.message = message; }
}
      
public class ExampleEvent {
    public String message;
}
                       
@Component
public class ExampleEventSource {
    private ExampleEvent createEventFromJavaBean(ExampleJavaBean bean) {
        return Converters.standardConverter().convert(bean)
                .to(ExampleEvent.class);
    }
    
    private Map&lt;String, Object&gt; createMapFromJavaBean(ExampleJavaBean bean) {
        return Converters.standardConverter().convert(bean)
                .to(new TypeReference&lt;Map&gt;String, Object&gt;&gt;(){});
    }
}</programlisting>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Event Mutability</title>
      
      <para>DTO types provide a simple yet powerful mechanism for defining an Event Schema in a 
      type-safe way, however their use of mutable public fields means that they are potentially
      dangerous when shared between threads. Bundles publishing or consuming events should 
      assume that their event instances are shared between threads and should not mutate 
      their fields after publication or receipt.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  
  <section>

    <title>Publishing Events</title>
    
    <para>To publish an event, the Event Source must retrieve the Typed Event Bus
    service from the OSGi service registry. The Event Source then creates an event
    object and calls one of the Typed Event Bus service's methods to publish the event.
    Event publication is asynchronous, meaning that when a call to the Typed Event Bus
    returns there is no guarantee that all (or even any) listeners have been notified.</para>
    
    <section xml:id="typedevent.event.topics">
      <title>Event Topics</title>

      <para>Events are always published to a topic. The topic of an event 
      defines the <emphasis>schema</emphasis> of the event. Topics exist
      in order to give Event Consumers information about the schema of
      the event, and the opportunity to register for just the events they 
      are interested in. When a topic is designed, its name should not 
      include any other information, such as the publisher of the event 
      or the data associated with the event, those
      parts are intended to be stored in the event properties.</para>

      <para>The topic therefore serves as a first-level filter for
      determining which handlers should receive the event. Typed Event service
      implementations use the structure of the topic to optimize the
      dispatching of the events to the handlers. The following
      example code demonstrates how to send an event to a topic.</para>
      
      <programlisting>public class ExampleEvent {
    public String message;
}         
            
@Component
public class ExampleEventSource {
    @Reference
    TypedEventBus bus;

    public void sendEvent() {
        ExampleEvent event = new ExampleEvent();
        event.message = "The time is " + LocalDateTime.now();

        bus.deliver("org/osgi/example/ExampleEvent", event);
    }
}</programlisting>

      <para>Topics are arranged in a hierarchical namespace. Each level is
      defined by a token and levels are separated by solidi (<code>'/'
      \u002F</code>). More precisely, the topic must conform to the following
      grammar:</para>

      <programlisting>  topic ::= token ( '/' token ) *    // See General Syntax Definitions in Core</programlisting>

      <para>Topics should be designed to become more specific when going from
      left to right. Consumers can provide a prefix that matches a topic, using
      the preferred order allows a handler to minimize the number of prefixes
      it needs to register.</para>

      <para>Topics are case-sensitive. As a convention, topics should follow
      the reverse domain name scheme used by Java packages to guarantee
      uniqueness. The separator must be a solidus (<code>'/' \u002F</code>)
      instead of the full stop (<code>'.' \u002E</code>).</para>

      <para>This specification uses the convention
      <code>fully/qualified/package/ClassName/ACTION</code>. If necessary, a
      pseudo-class-name is used.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Automatically Generated Topics</title>
      
      <para>In many cases the name of a topic contains no information other than
      defining the schema of the events sent on that topic. Therefore when publishing
      a Typed Event to the Typed Event Bus the Typed Event implementation is able to
      automatically generate a topic name based on the the type of the event object
      being published.</para>
      
      <para>For all publication methods on the Typed Event Bus where no topic string
      is provided the implementation must create a topic string using the fully
      qualified class name of the event object. The use of a fully qualified
      class name, including full stop separators, helps to distinguish between
      automatically generated topic names and other topics.</para>
      
      <para>The following example demonstrates how to make use of an
      automatically generated topic name.</para>
      
      <programlisting>package org.osgi.example;

public class ExampleEvent {
    public String message;
}          
            
@Component
public class ExampleEventSource {
    @Reference
    TypedEventBus bus;

    public void sendEvent() {
        ExampleEvent event = new ExampleEvent();
        event.message = "The time is " + LocalDateTime.now();

        //This event will be delivered to the topic "org.osgi.example.ExampleEvent"
        bus.deliver(event);
    }
}</programlisting>
    </section>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title>Receiving Events</title>
    
    <para>Event Consumers can Receive events by registering an appropriate Event Handler 
    service in the Service Registry. This is a 
    <xref linkend="org.osgi.service.typedevent.TypedEventHandler" xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> 
    to receive events as type-safe objects, or an
    <xref linkend="org.osgi.service.typedevent.UntypedEventHandler" xrefstyle="hyperlink"/>
    to receive events as untyped Map structures.</para>
    
    <para>Published events are then delivered, using the whiteboard pattern, to any 
    Event Handler service which has registered interest in the topic to which the event 
    was published.</para>
    
    <section>
      <title>Receiving Typed Events</title>
      
      <para>Typed Events are received by registering a <code>TypedEventHandler</code> implementation. 
      This service has a single method <code>notify</code> which receives the String topic name and 
      Object event data. The TypedEventHandler implementation must be registered as a service in the 
      service registry using the TypedEventHandler interface.</para>
      
      <para>The TypedEventHandler interface is parameterized, and so it is expected that the implementation 
      reifies the type parameter into a specific type. In this case the Typed Event implementation must 
      adapt the Event object into the type defined by the TypedEventHandler implementation.
      Implementations of this specification are free to choose their own adaptation mechanism,
      however it must guarantee at least the same functionality as <xref linkend="util.converter"/></para>
      
      <para>A simple example of receiving a typed event follows:</para>
      
      <programlisting>public class ExampleEvent {
    public String message;
}
            
            
@Component
public class ExampleTypedConsumer implements TypedEventHandler&lt;ExampleEvent&gt; {
    @Override
    public void notify(String topic, ExampleEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Received event: " + event.message);
    }
}</programlisting>
      
      <para>If the TypedEventHandler implementation is unable to reify the type, or the required type is 
      more specific than the reified type, then the Typed Event Handler must be registered with the 
      <code>event.type</code> service property. This property has a string value containing the 
      fully-qualified type name of the type that the Typed Event Handler expects to receive. This type must 
      be loaded by the Typed Event implementation using the classloader of the bundle which registered the 
      Typed Event Handler service. The loaded type must then be used as the target type when converting events.
      For example:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting>public class ExampleEvent {
    public String message;
}
            
public class SpecialisedExampleEvent extends ExampleEvent {
    public int sequenceId = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
}
            
@Component
@EventType(SpecialisedExampleEvent.class)
public class ExampleTypedConsumer implements TypedEventHandler&lt;ExampleEvent&gt; {
    @Override
    public void notify(String topic, ExampleEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Received event: " + event.message);
        
        // The event will always be of type SpecialisedExampleEvent
        System.out.println("Event sequence id was " + 
            ((SpecialisedExampleEvent) event).sequenceId);
    }
}</programlisting>
      
      <para>By default the reified type of the TypedEventHandler will be used as the target topic for the 
      Event Handler. If the <code>event.type</code> property is set then this is used as the default topic instead of the 
      reified type. To use a specific named topic the Typed Event Handler service may be registered with an 
      <code>event.topics</code> service property specifying the topic(s) as a String+ value.</para>
      
      <programlisting>public class ExampleEvent {
    public String message;
}
                       
@Component
@EventTopics({"foo", "foo/bar"})
public class ExampleTypedConsumer implements TypedEventHandler&lt;ExampleEvent&gt; {
    @Override
    public void notify(String topic, ExampleEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Event received on topic: " + topic + 
                " with message: " + event.message);
    }
}</programlisting>   
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Receiving Untyped Events</title>
      
      <para>Untyped Events are received by registering an <code>UntypedEventHandler</code> implementation. 
      This service has a single method notifyUntyped which receives the <code>String</code> topic name and 
      <code>Map</code> event data. The Untyped Event Handler implementation must be registered as a service in 
      the service registry using the <code>UntypedEventHandler</code> interface.</para>
      
      <para>When delivering an event to an Untyped Event Handler the Typed Event Service must, if necessary,
      convert the event data to a nested map structure.</para>
      
      <para>The <code>event.topics</code> service property must be used when registering an Untyped Event Hander service. 
      If it is not then no events will be delivered to that Untyped Event Handler service</para>
      
      <programlisting>public class ExampleEvent {
    public String message;
}
                       
@Component
@EventTopics({"foo", "foo/bar"})
public class ExampleUntypedConsumer implements UntypedEventHandler {
    @Override
    public void notifyUntyped(String topic, Map&lt;String,Object&gt; event) {

    <section>
      <title>Wildcard Topics</title>
      
      <para>The <code>event.topics</code> property may contain one or more wildcard topics. These are Strings which contain 
      a topic name and append “/*”. This value means that the Event Handler must be called for Events in the 
      named topic and all sub-topics</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Unhandled Events</title>
      
      <para>Unhandled Events are events sent by an Event Source but which have no Event Handler service listening
      to their topic. Rather than these events being discarded, the Typed Event implementation will search the 
      service registry for services implementing <xref linkend="org.osgi.service.typedevent.UnhandledEventHandler" 
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/>.</para>
      <para>If any services are found then the Typed Event implementation will call the <code>notifyUnhandled</code> 
      method passing the topic name and event data to all of the registered Unhandled Event Handler services.</para>
      
      <programlisting>public class ExampleEvent {
    public String message;
}
                       
@Component
public class ExampleUnhandledConsumer implements UnhandledEventHandler {
    @Override

      <title>Error Handling</title>
      
      <para>There are several possible error scenarios for Event Handlers:</para>
      
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><code>TypedEventHandler</code> - If the target event type is not discoverable, that is there is no 
          reified type information, nor is there an <code>event.type</code> property, then the target type for the 
          event is not known. In this situation there is no way for the Typed Event implementation to correctly target 
          an event schema, and the <code>TypedEventHandler</code> must be ignored. The implementation must write a 
          message to the log indicating which service is being ignored.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><code>TypedEventHandler</code> - If the target event type is discoverable but cannot be loaded
          using the classloader of the bundle which registered the Typed Event Handler service then there is no 
          way for the Typed Event implementation to correctly target an event schema, and the Event Handler must 
          be ignored. </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>All Handler Types - If the event data cannot be adapted to the target type, that is the incoming
          data cannot be transformed due to badly mismatched property names or values, then that specific Event 
          cannot be submitted to the Handler. The Typed Event implementation must write a message to the log 
          indicating which service failed to receive the event. If this error occurs repeatedly then the Typed Event 
          implementation may choose to deny list and ignore the Event Handler service. Deny listing decisions
          must be written to the log.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>All Handler Types - If the <code>event.topics</code> property contains one or more invalid 
          values then the Event Handler service must be ignored. The implementation must write a message to the 
          log indicating which service is being ignored.</para>

  <section>
    <title>The Typed Event Bus Service</title>
    
    <para>The Typed Event implementation must register a Typed Event Bus service in the service registry. This
    service must implement and advertise the <xref linkend="org.osgi.service.typedevent.TypedEventBus" 
    xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> interface.</para>
      
    <section>
      <title>Error Handling</title>
      
      <para>It is not possible to know that an Event cannot be delivered until delivery is attempted. It is 
      therefore not possible (or acceptable, given the asynchronous nature of delivery) to throw an exception 
      to the sender of an event if there are problems delivering the event. The Event Bus service should not 
      throw exceptions from any publication methods except:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para><code>NullPointerException</code> if the event data is <code>null</code>.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Monitoring Events</title> 
    
    <para>An important part of a software system is the ability to monitor it appropriately to determine 
    whether it is functioning correctly, without having the measurements disrupt the system. To this end 
    the Typed Event implementation must register a <xref linkend="org.osgi.service.typedevent.monitor.TypedEventMonitor" 
    xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> service which can be used to monitor the flow of events through the Event Bus.</para>
    
    <para>Events flowing through the Typed Event Bus can be monitored using one of the <code>monitorEvents</code> 
    methods from the <code>TypedEventMonitor</code> service. These methods return a 
    <xref linkend="org.osgi.util.pushstream.PushStream" xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> which delivers
    <xref linkend="org.osgi.service.typedevent.monitor.MonitorEvent"  xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> 
    instances each time an event is sent via the <code>TypedEventBus</code>. The monitor events contain the event 
    topic, the event data, and a timestamp indicating when the event was sent.</para>
    
    <section>
      <title>Event History</title>
      
      <para>In a running system it is often useful for monitoring tools to replay recent data immediately 
      after a problem has occurred. For that reason Typed Event Monitor instances may store past events so that 
      they can be replayed if requested. There are two <code>monitorEvents</code> methods capable of replaying history</para>
      
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><xref linkend="org.osgi.service.typedevent.monitor.TypedEventMonitor.monitorEvents-int-" xrefstyle="hyperlink"/>  
          takes an <code>int</code> representing the number of past events that should be replayed from the cached history</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><xref linkend="org.osgi.service.typedevent.monitor.TypedEventMonitor.monitorEvents-Instant-" xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> 
          takes an <code>Instant</code>, representing the time in the past from which the stream of monitoring events should start.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Note that storing Event History is considered a best-effort option and it is not required that the 
      implementation supply the full set of requested events. If insufficient past events are available then the 
      implementation must provide the maximum amount of history available.</para>

    <title>Capabilities</title>
    
    <section>
      <title>osgi.implementation Capability</title>

      <para>The Typed Event implementation bundle must provide the <link
      linkend="service.namespaces-osgi.implementation.namespace"><code>osgi.implementation</code></link>
      capability with the name <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.typedevent.TypedEventConstants.TYPED_EVENT_IMPLEMENTATION"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/>. This capability can be used by provisioning
      tools and during resolution to ensure that a Typed Event implementation
      is present. The capability must also declare a uses constraint for the
      <code>org.osgi.service.typedevent</code> package and provide the version of
      this specification:</para>

      <programlisting>Provide-Capability: osgi.implementation;
       osgi.implementation="osgi.typedevent";
       uses:="org.osgi.service.typedevent";
       version:Version="<xref endterm="org.osgi.service.typedevent-version.number"
          linkend="org.osgi.service.typedevent"/>"</programlisting>

      <para>The <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.typedevent.annotations.RequireTypedEvents"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> annotation can be used to require this
      capability.</para>

      <para>This capability must follow the rules defined for the <xref
      linkend="service.namespaces-osgi.implementation.namespace"/>.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>osgi.service Capability</title>

      <para>The bundle providing the Typed Event Bus service must provide 
      capabilities in the <link
      linkend="service.namespaces-osgi.service.namespace"><code>osgi.service</code></link>
      namespace representing the services it is required to register. This capability must 
      also declare uses constraints for the relevant service packages:</para>

      <programlisting>Provide-Capability: osgi.service;
  objectClass:List&lt;String&gt;="org.osgi.service.typedevent.TypedEventBus";
  uses:="org.osgi.service.typedevent",
  osgi.service;
  objectClass:List&lt;String&gt;="org.osgi.service.typedevent.monitor.TypedEventMonitor";
  uses:="org.osgi.service.typedevent"</programlisting>

      <para>This capability must follow the rules defined for the <xref
      linkend="service.namespaces-osgi.service.namespace"/>.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Security</title>
    
    <section>
      <title>Topic Permission</title>

      <para>The <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.typedevent.TopicPermission"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> class allows fine-grained control
      over which bundles may post events to a given topic and which bundles
      may receive those events.</para>

      <para>The target parameter for the permission is the topic name.
      <code>TopicPermission</code> classes uses a wildcard matching algorithm
      similar to the <code>BasicPermission</code> class, except that solidi
      (<code>'/' \u002F</code>) are used as separators instead of full stop
      characters. For example, a name of <code>a/b/*</code> implies
      <code>a/b/c</code> but not <code>x/y/z</code> or
      <code>a/b</code>.</para>

      <para>There are two available actions: <code>PUBLISH</code> and
      <code>SUBSCRIBE</code>. These control a bundle's ability to either
      publish or receive events, respectively. Neither one implies the
      other.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Required Permissions</title>

      <para>Bundles that need to consume events must be granted permission to
      register the appropriate handler service. For Example:
      <code>ServicePermission</code>[<code>org.osgi.service.typedevent.TypedEventHandler</code>,
      <code>REGISTER</code>] or 
      <code>ServicePermission</code>[<code>org.osgi.service.typedevent.UntypedEventHandler</code>,
      <code>REGISTER</code>] or 
      <code>ServicePermission</code>[<code>org.osgi.service.typedevent.UnhandledEventHandler</code>,
      <code>REGISTER</code>]. In addition, bundles that consume events require
      <code>TopicPermission[ &lt;topic&gt;, SUBSCRIBE ]</code> for each topic
      they want to be notified about.</para>

      <para>Bundles that need to publish events must be granted permission
      to get the <code>TypedEventBus</code> service, that is
      <code>ServicePermission[ org.osgi.service.typedevent.TypedEventBus, GET]</code>
      so that they may retrieve the Typed Event Bus and use it. In
      addition, event sources require <code>TopicPermission[ &lt;topic&gt;,
      PUBLISH]</code> for each topic they want to send events to. This
      includes any default topic names that are used when publishing</para>

      <para>Bundles that need to monitor events flowing through the bus must be granted permission
      to get the <code>TypedEventMonitor</code> service, that is
      <code>ServicePermission[ org.osgi.service.typedevent.monitor.TypedEventMonitor, GET]</code>
      so that they may retrieve the Typed Event Monitor and use it.</para>

      <para>Only a bundle that provides a Typed Event implementation
      should be granted <code>ServicePermission[
      org.osgi.service.typedevent.TypedEventBus, REGISTER]</code> and
      <code>ServicePermission[
      org.osgi.service.typedevent.monitor.TypedEventMonitor, REGISTER]</code> to register the
      services defined by this specification.</para>

      <para>The Typed Event implementation must be granted
      <code>ServicePermission[org.osgi.service.typedevent.TypedEventHandler, GET]</code>,
      <code>ServicePermission[org.osgi.service.typedevent.UntypedEventHandler, GET]</code>,
      <code>ServicePermission[org.osgi.service.typedevent.UnhandledEventHandler, GET]</code>,
      <code>ServicePermission[org.osgi.service.typedevent.TypedEventBus, REGISTER]</code> and
      <code>ServicePermission[org.osgi.service.typedevent.monitor.TypedEventMonitor, REGISTER]</code>
      as these actions are all required to implement the specification.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Security Context During Event Callbacks</title>

      <para>During an event notification, the Typed Event implementation's
      Protection Domain will be on the stack above the handler's Protection Domain.
      Therefore, if a handler needs to perform a secure operation using
      its own privileges, it must invoke the <code>doPrivileged</code> method
      to isolate its security context from that of its caller.</para>

      <para>The event delivery mechanism must not wrap event notifications in
      a <code>doPrivileged</code> call.</para>

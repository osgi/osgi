  <title>OSGi Specification License, Version 2.0</title>

  <section>
    <title>License Grant</title>

    <para>OSGi Alliance ("OSGi") hereby grants you a fully-paid,
    non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, limited license (without the
    right to sublicense), under OSGi's applicable intellectual property rights
    to view, download, and reproduce this OSGi Specification ("Specification")
    which follows this License Agreement ("Agreement"). You are not authorized
    to create any derivative work of the Specification. However, to the extent
    that an implementation of the Specification would necessarily be a
    derivative work of the Specification, OSGi also grants you a perpetual,
    non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, limited license
    (without the right to sublicense) under any applicable copyrights, to
    create and/or distribute an implementation of the Specification that: (i)
    fully implements the Specification including all its required interfaces
    and functionality; (ii) does not modify, subset, superset or otherwise
    extend the OSGi Name Space, or include any public or protected packages,
    classes, Java interfaces, fields or methods within the OSGi Name Space
    other than those required and authorized by the Specification. An
    implementation that does not satisfy limitations (i)-(ii) is not
    considered an implementation of the Specification, does not receive the
    benefits of this license, and must not be described as an implementation
    of the Specification. An implementation of the Specification must not
    claim to be a compliant implementation of the Specification unless it
    passes the OSGi Compliance Tests for the Specification in accordance with
    OSGi processes. "OSGi Name Space" shall mean the public class or interface
    declarations whose names begin with "org.osgi" or any recognized
    successors or replacements thereof.</para>

    <para>OSGi Participants (as such term is defined in the OSGi Intellectual
    Property Rights Policy) have made non-assert and licensing commitments
    regarding patent claims necessary to implement the Specification, if any,
    under the OSGi Intellectual Property Rights Policy which is available for
    examination on the OSGi public web site (www.osgi.org).</para>

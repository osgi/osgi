    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The OSGi Framework contains a procedural service model which
    provides a publish/find/bind model for using
    <emphasis>services</emphasis>. This model is elegant and powerful, it
    enables the building of applications out of bundles that communicate and
    collaborate using these services.</para>

    <para>This specification addresses some of the complications that arise
    when the OSGi service model is used for larger systems and wider
    deployments, such as:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Startup Time</emphasis> - The procedural service model
        requires a bundle to actively register and acquire its services. This
        is normally done at startup time, requiring all present bundles to be
        initialized with a Bundle Activator. In larger systems, this quickly
        results in unacceptably long startup times.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Memory Footprint</emphasis> - A service registered
        with the Framework implies that the implementation, and related
        classes and objects, are loaded in memory. If the service is never
        used, this memory is unnecessarily occupied. The creation of a class
        loader may therefore cause significant overhead.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Complexity</emphasis> - Service can come and go at any
        time. This dynamic behavior makes the service programming model more
        complex than more traditional models. This complexity negatively
        influences the adoption of the OSGi service model as well as the
        robustness and reliability of applications because these applications
        do not always handle the dynamicity correctly.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The <emphasis>service component</emphasis> model uses a declarative
    model for publishing, finding and binding to OSGi services. This model
    simplifies the task of authoring OSGi services by performing the work of
    registering the service and handling service dependencies. This minimizes
    the amount of code a programmer has to write; it also allows service
    components to be loaded only when they are needed. As a result, bundles
    need not provide a <code>BundleActivator</code> class to collaborate with
    others through the service registry.</para>

    <para>From a system perspective, the service component model means reduced
    startup time and potentially a reduction of the memory footprint. From a
    programmer's point of view the service component model provides a
    simplified programming model.</para>

    <para>The Service Component model makes use of concepts described in <xref
    linkend="i1550732"/>.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Backward Compatibility</emphasis> - The service
          component model must operate seamlessly with the existing service
          model.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Size Constraints</emphasis> - The service component
          model must not require memory and performance intensive subsystems.
          The model must also be applicable on resource constrained
          devices.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Delayed Activation</emphasis> - The service
          component model must allow delayed activation of a service
          component. Delayed activation allows for delayed class loading and
          object creation until needed, thereby reducing the overall memory
          footprint.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Simplicity</emphasis> - The programming model for

          programmer to learn a complicated API or XML sub-language.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Dependency Injection</emphasis> - The programming
          model for using declarative services supports three types of
          dependency injection: method injection, field injection, and
          constructor injection.</para>
        </listitem>

      <title>Synopsis</title>

      <para>The Service Component Runtime reads component descriptions from
      started bundles. These descriptions are in the form of XML documents
      which define a set of components for a bundle. A component can refer to
      a number of services that must be available before a component
      configuration becomes satisfied. These dependencies are defined in the
      descriptions and the specific target services can be influenced by
      configuration information in the Configuration Admin service. After a
      component configuration becomes satisfied, a number of different
      scenarios can take place depending on the component type:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Immediate Component</emphasis> - The component
          configuration of an immediate component must be activated
          immediately after becoming satisfied. Immediate components may
          provide a service.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Delayed Component</emphasis> - When a component
          configuration of a delayed component becomes satisfied, SCR will
          register the service specified by the <code>service</code> element
          without activating the component configuration. If this service is
          requested, SCR must activate the component configuration creating an
          instance of the component implementation class that will be returned
          as the service object. If the <code>scope</code> attribute of the
          <code>service</code> element is <code>bundle</code>, then, for each
          distinct bundle that requests the service object, a different
          component configuration is created and activated and a new instance
          of the component implementation class is returned as the service
          object. If the <code>scope</code> attribute of the
          <code>service</code> element is <code>prototype</code>, then, for
          each distinct request for the service object, such as via
          <code>ServiceObjects</code>, a different component configuration is
          created and activated and a new instance of the component
          implementation class is returned as the service object.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Factory Component</emphasis> - If a component's
          description specifies the <code>factory</code> attribute of the
          <code>component</code> element, SCR will register a Component
          Factory service. This service allows client bundles to create and
          activate multiple component configurations and dispose of them. If
          the component's description also specifies a <code>service</code>
          element, then as each component configuration is activated, SCR will
          register it as a service.</para>

          the model with a number of examples. The section about <xref

  <section xml:id="service.component-components">
    <title>Components</title>

    <para>A component is a normal Java class contained within a bundle. The
    distinguishing aspect of a component is that it is
    <emphasis>declared</emphasis> in an XML document. Component configurations
    are activated and deactivated under the full control of SCR. SCR bases its
    decisions on the information in the component's description. This
    information consists of basic component information like the name and
    type, optional services that are implemented by the component, and
    <emphasis>references</emphasis>. References are dependencies that the
    component has on other services.</para>

    <para>SCR must <emphasis>activate</emphasis> a component configuration
    when the component is enabled and the component configuration is satisfied
    and a component configuration is needed. During the life time of a
    component configuration, SCR can notify the component of changes in its
    bound references.</para>

    <para>SCR will <emphasis>deactivate</emphasis> a previously activated
    component configuration when the component becomes disabled, the component
    configuration becomes unsatisfied, or the component configuration is no
    longer needed.</para>

    <para>If an activated component configuration's configuration properties
    change, SCR must either notify the component configuration of the change,
    if the component description specifies a method to be notified of such
    changes, or deactivate the component configuration and then attempt to
    reactivate the component configuration using the new configuration
    information.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Declaring a Component</title>

      <para>A component requires the following artifacts in the bundle:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>An XML document that contains the component
          description.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The <code>Service-Component</code> manifest header which names
          the XML documents that contain the component descriptions.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>An implementation class that is specified in the component
          description.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The elements in the component's description are defined in <xref
      linkend="service.component-component.description"/>. The XML grammar for
      the component declaration is defined by the XML Schema, see <xref
      linkend="service.component-schema"/>.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Immediate Component</title>

      <para>An <emphasis>immediate component</emphasis> is activated as soon
      as its dependencies are satisfied. If an immediate component has no
      dependencies, it is activated immediately. A component is an immediate
      component if it is not a factory component and either does not specify a
      service or specifies a service and the <code>immediate</code> attribute
      of the <code>component</code> element set to <code>true</code>. If an
      immediate component configuration is satisfied and specifies a service,
      SCR must register the component configuration as a service in the
      service registry and then activate the component configuration.</para>

      <para>For example, the bundle entry <code>/OSGI-INF/activator.xml</code>
      contains:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;scr:component name="example.activator"
    xmlns:scr="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.5.0"&gt;
    &lt;implementation class="com.acme.impl.Activator"/&gt;
&lt;/scr:component&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The manifest header <code>Service-Component</code> must also be
      specified in the bundle manifest. For example:</para>

      <programlisting>Service-Component: OSGI-INF/activator.xml</programlisting>

      <para>An example class for this component could look like:</para>

      <programlisting>public class Activator {
    public Activator() {...}
    private void activate(BundleContext context) {...}
    private void deactivate() {...}  
}</programlisting>

      <para>This example component is virtually identical to a Bundle
      Activator. It has no references to other services so it will be
      satisfied immediately. It publishes no service so SCR will activate a
      component configuration immediately.</para>

      <para>The <code>activate</code> method is called when SCR activates the
      component configuration and the <code>deactivate</code> method is called
      when SCR deactivates the component configuration. If the
      <code>activate</code> method throws an Exception, then the component
      configuration is not activated and will be discarded.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Delayed Component</title>

      <para>A <emphasis>delayed component</emphasis> specifies a service, is
      not specified to be a factory component and does not have the
      <code>immediate</code> attribute of the <code>component</code> element
      set to <code>true</code>. If a delayed component configuration is
      satisfied, SCR must register the component configuration as a service in
      the service registry but the activation of the component configuration
      is delayed until the registered service is requested. The registered
      service of a delayed component looks like a normal registered service
      but does not incur the overhead of an ordinarily registered service that
      require a service's bundle to be initialized to register the
      service.</para>

      <para>For example, a bundle needs to see events of a specific topic. The
      Event Admin uses the white board pattern, receiving the events is
      therefore as simple as registering a Event Handler service. The example
      XML for the delayed component looks like:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;scr:component name="example.handler"
    xmlns:scr="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.5.0"&gt;
    &lt;implementation class="com.acme.impl.HandlerImpl"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="event.topics"&gt;some/topic&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;service&gt; 
        &lt;provide interface="org.osgi.service.event.EventHandler"/&gt; 
    &lt;/service&gt;
&lt;/scr:component&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The associated component class looks like:</para>

      <programlisting>public class HandlerImpl implements EventHandler{
    public void handleEvent(Event evt ) {
        ...
  }
}</programlisting>

      <para>The component configuration will only be activated once the Event
      Admin service requires the service because it has an event to deliver on
      the topic to which the component subscribed.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="service.component-factorycomponent">
      <title>Factory Component</title>

      <para>Certain software patterns require the creation of component
      configurations on demand. For example, a component could represent an
      application that can be launched multiple times and each application
      instance can then quit independently. Such a pattern requires a factory
      that creates the instances. This pattern is supported with a
      <emphasis>factory component</emphasis>. A factory component is used if
      the <code>factory</code> attribute of the <code>component</code> element
      is set to a <emphasis>factory identifier</emphasis>. This identifier can
      be used by a bundle to associate the factory with externally defined
      information.</para>

      <para>SCR must register a Component Factory service on behalf of the
      component as soon as the component factory is satisfied. The service
      properties for the Component Factory service are the <emphasis>factory
      properties</emphasis> as specified by the <code>factory-property</code>
      and <code>factory-properties</code> elements of the component
      description. See <xref
      linkend="service.component-factoryproperty.factoryproperties.elements"/>.
      The service properties of the Component Factory service must not include
      the component properties. SCR always adds the following factory
      properties, which cannot be overridden:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><code>component.name</code> - The name of the
          component.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><code>component.factory</code> - The factory
          identifier.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>New configurations of the component can be created and activated
      by calling the <code>newInstance</code> method on this Component Factory
      service. The <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.component.ComponentFactory.newInstance-Dictionary-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method has a <code>Dictionary</code> object as a
      parameter. This Dictionary object is merged with the component
      properties as described in <xref
      linkend="service.component-component.properties"/>. If the component
      specifies a service, then the service is registered after the created
      component configuration is satisfied with the component properties. Then
      the component configuration is activated.</para>

      <para>For example, a component can provide a connection to a USB device.
      Such a connection should normally not be shared and should be created
      each time such a service is needed. The component description to

      <para>A factory component can be associated with a service. In that

      <para>A new service will be registered each time a new component
      configuration is created and activated with the <code>newInstance</code>
      method. This allows a bundle other than the one creating the component
      configuration to utilize the service. If the component configuration is
      deactivated, the service must be unregistered.</para>

    <title>References to Services</title>

    <para>Most bundles will require access to other services from the service
    registry. The dynamics of the service registry require care and attention
    of the programmer because referenced services, once acquired, could be
    unregistered at any moment. The component model simplifies the handling of
    these service dependencies significantly.</para>

    <para>The services that are selected by a reference are called the
    <emphasis>target services</emphasis>. These are the services selected by
    the <code>BundleContext.getServiceReferences</code> method where the first
    argument is the reference's interface and the second argument is the
    reference's target property, which must be a valid filter.</para>

    <para>A component configuration becomes <emphasis>satisfied</emphasis>
    when each specified reference is satisfied. A reference is
    <emphasis>satisfied</emphasis> if it specifies optional cardinality or
    when the number of target services is equal to or more than the minimum
    cardinality of the reference. An activated component configuration that
    becomes <emphasis>unsatisfied</emphasis> must be deactivated.</para>

    <para>During the activation of a component configuration, SCR must bind
    some or all of the target services of a reference to the component
    configuration. Any target service that is bound to the component
    configuration is called a <emphasis>bound</emphasis> service. See <xref

          are the bind, updated, and unbind methods specified by the
          reference. Method injection is useful if the component needs to be
          notified of changes to the bound services for a dynamic

      <para>Alternatively, the component could use method injection and ask to
      be notified with the Logger Factory service by declaring bind, updated,
      and unbind methods.</para>

        updated="updatedLog"
        unbind="unsetLog"

&lt;/scr:component&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The component implementation class looks like:</para>

      <programlisting>public class LogEventImpl {

    <section xml:id="service.component-reference.cardinality">
      <title>Reference Cardinality</title>

      <para>A component implementation is always written with a certain
      <emphasis>cardinality</emphasis> for each reference in mind. The
      cardinality represents two important concepts:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Multiplicity</emphasis> - Does the component
          implementation assume a single service or does it explicitly handle
          multiple services? For example, when a component uses the Logger
          Factory service, it only needs to bind to one Logger Factory service
          to function correctly. Alternatively, when the Configuration Admin
          uses the Configuration Listener services it needs to bind to all
          target services present in the service registry to dispatch its
          events correctly.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Optionality</emphasis> - Can the component function
          without any bound service present? Some components can still perform
          useful tasks even when no service is available; other components
          must bind to at least one service before they can be useful. For
          example, the Configuration Admin in the previous example must still
          provide its functionality even if there are no Configuration
          Listener services present. Alternatively, an application that
          registers a Servlet with the Http Service has little to do when the
          Http Service is not present, it should therefore use a reference
          with a mandatory cardinality.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The cardinality is expressed with the following syntax:</para>

      <programlisting>cardinality  ::= optionality '..' multiplicity
optionality  ::= '0' | '1'
multiplicity ::= '1' | 'n'</programlisting>

      <para>The cardinality for a reference can be specified as one of four
      choices:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><code>0..1</code> - Optional and unary.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><code>1..1</code> - Mandatory and unary (Default) .</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><code>0..n</code> - Optional and multiple.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><code>1..n</code> - Mandatory and multiple.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The <emphasis>minimum cardinality</emphasis> is specified by the
      optionality part of the cardinality. This is either <code>0</code> or
      <code>1</code>. A minimum cardinality property can be used to raise the
      minimum cardinality of a reference from this initial value. For example,
      a <code>0..n</code> cardinality in the component description can be
      raised into a <code>3..n</code> cardinality at runtime by setting the
      minimum cardinality property for the reference to <code>3</code>. This
      would typically be done by a deployer setting the minimum cardinality
      property in a configuration for the component. The minimum cardinality
      for a unary cardinality cannot exceed <code>1</code>. See <xref
      linkend="service.component-minimum.cardinality.property"/> for more
      information.</para>

      <para>A reference is <emphasis>satisfied</emphasis> if the number of
      target services is equal to or more than the minimum cardinality. The
      <code>multiplicity</code> is irrelevant for the satisfaction of the
      reference. The <code>multiplicity</code> only specifies if the component
      implementation is written to handle being bound to multiple services
      (<code>n</code>) or requires SCR to select and bind to a single service
      (<code>1</code>).</para>

      <para>When a satisfied component configuration is activated, there must
      be at most one bound service for each reference with a unary cardinality
      and at least as many bound services as the minimum cardinality for each
      reference. If the cardinality constraints cannot be maintained after a
      component configuration is activated, that is the reference becomes
      unsatisfied, the component configuration must be deactivated. If the
      reference has a unary cardinality and there is more than one target
      service for the reference, then the bound service must be the target
      service whose <code>ServiceReference</code> is first in the ranking
      order as specified in <code>ServiceReference.compareTo</code>.</para>

      <para>In the following example, a component wants to register a resource
      with all Http Services that are available. Such a scenario has the
      cardinality of <code>0..n</code>. The code must be prepared to handle
      multiple calls to the bind method for each Http Service in such a case.
      In this example, the code uses the <code>registerResources</code> method
      to register a directory for external access.</para>

    <section xml:id="service.component-reference.scope">
      <title>Reference Scope</title>

      <para>A component implementation must be written to understand the
      service scope of referenced services. The <emphasis>reference
      scope</emphasis> defines whether the component expects the bundle to be
      exposed to a single service object for a bound service or to potentially
      multiple services objects. The following reference scopes are
      available:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>bundle</emphasis> - For all references to a given
          bound service, all activated component instances within a bundle
          must use the same service object. That is, for a given bound
          service, all component instances within a bundle will be using the
          same service object. This is the default reference scope.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>prototype</emphasis> - For all references to a given
          bound service, each activated component instance may use a single,
          distinct service object. That is, for a given bound service, each
          component instance may use a distinct service object but within a
          component instance all references to the bound service will use the
          same service object.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>prototype_required</emphasis> - For all references
          to a given bound service, each activated component instance must use
          a single, distinct service object. That is, for a given bound
          service, each component instance will use a distinct service object
          but within a component instance all references to the bound service
          will use the same service object.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>For a bound service of a reference with bundle reference scope,
      SCR must get the service object from the OSGi Framework's service
      registry using the <code>getService</code> method on the component's
      Bundle Context. If the service object for a bound service has been
      obtained and the service becomes unbound, SCR must unget the service
      object using the <code>ungetService</code> method on the component's
      Bundle Context and discard all references to the service object. This
      ensures that the bundle will only be exposed to a single instance of the
      service object at any given time.</para>

      <para>For a bound service of a reference with prototype or
      prototype_required reference scope, SCR must use a Service Objects
      object obtained from the OSGi Framework's service registry using the
      component's Bundle Context to get any service objects. If service
      objects for a bound service have been obtained and the service becomes
      unbound, SCR must unget any unreleased service objects using the Service
      Objects object obtained from the OSGi Framework's service registry using
      the component's Bundle Context. This means that if a component instance
      used a Component Service Objects object to obtain service objects, SCR
      must track those service objects so that when the service becomes
      unbound, SCR can unget any unreleased service objects.</para>

      <para>Additionally, for a reference with prototype_required reference
      scope, only services registered with prototype service scope can be
      considered as target services. This ensures that each component instance
      can be exposed to a single, distinct instance of the service object.
      Using prototype_required reference scope effectively adds
      <code>service.scope=prototype</code> to the target property for the
      reference. A service that does not use prototype service scope cannot be
      used as a bound service for a reference with prototype_required
      reference scope since the service cannot provide a distinct service
      object for each component instance.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="service.component-reference.policy">
      <title>Reference Policy</title>

      <para>Once all the references of a component are satisfied, a component
      configuration can be activated and therefore bound to target services.
      However, the dynamic nature of the OSGi service registry makes it likely
      that services are registered, modified and unregistered after target
      services are bound. These changes in the service registry could make one
      or more bound services no longer a target service thereby making
      obsolete any object references that the component has to these service
      objects. Components therefore must specify a <emphasis>policy</emphasis>
      how to handle these changes in the set of bound services. A
      <emphasis>policy-option</emphasis> can further refine how changes affect
      bound services.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Static Reference Policy</title>

        <para>The <emphasis>static policy</emphasis> is the most simple policy
        and is the default policy. A reference with a static policy is called
        a <emphasis>static reference</emphasis>. A component instance never
        sees any of the dynamics of the static reference. The bind method is
        called and/or the field is set before the component instance is
        activated. Static references can also be used for parameters for
        constructor injection. Component configurations are deactivated before
        any bound service for the static reference becomes unavailable. If a
        target service is available to replace the bound service which became
        unavailable, the component configuration must be reactivated and the
        replacement service is bound to the new component instance.</para>

        <para>If the <code>policy-option</code> is <code>reluctant</code> then
        the registration of an additional target service for a reference must
        not result in deactivating and reactivating a component configuration.
        If the <code>policy-option</code> is <code>greedy</code> then the
        component configuration must be reactivated when new applicable
        services become available. See <xref
        linkend="service.component-policy.option.action"
        xrefstyle="template:Table %n on page %p"/>.</para>

        <para>If a static reference specifies an updated method and the bound
        service's properties change, SCR must call the updated method.</para>

        <para>The static policy can be very expensive if it depends on
        services that frequently unregister and re-register or if the cost of
        activating and deactivating a component configuration is high. Static
        policy is usually also not applicable if the cardinality specifies
        multiple bound services.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Dynamic Reference Policy</title>

        <para>The <emphasis>dynamic policy</emphasis> is slightly more complex
        since the component implementation must properly handle changes in the
        set of bound services that can occur on any thread at any time after
        the component instance is created. A reference with a dynamic policy
        is called a <emphasis>dynamic reference</emphasis>. With a dynamic
        reference, SCR can change the set of bound services without
        deactivating a component configuration. If the component uses method
        injection to access services, then the component instance will be
        notified of changes in the set of bound services by calls to the bind,
        updated, and unbind methods.</para>

        <para>If the <code>policy-option</code> is <code>reluctant</code> then
        a bound reference is not rebound even if a more suitable service
        becomes available for a 1..1 or 0..1 reference. If the
        <code>policy-option</code> is <code>greedy</code> then the component
        must be unbound and rebound for that reference. See <xref
        linkend="service.component-policy.option.action"
        xrefstyle="template:Table %n on page %p"/>.</para>

        <para>The previous example with the registering of a resource
        directory used a static policy. This implied that the component
        configurations are deactivated when there is a change in the bound set
        of Http Services. The code in the example can be seen to easily handle
        the dynamics of Http Services that come and go. The component
        description can therefore be updated to:</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;/scr:component&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>The code is identical to the previous example.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Reference Policy Option</title>

      <para>The reference policy option defines how eager the reference is to
      rebind when a new, potentially a higher ranking, target service becomes
      available. The reference policy option can have the following
      values:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><code>reluctant</code> - Minimize rebinding and reactivating.
          This is the default reference policy option.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><code>greedy</code> - Maximize the use of the best service by
          deactivating static references or rebinding dynamic
          references.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para><xref linkend="service.component-policy.option.action"/> defines
      the actions that are taken when a <emphasis>better</emphasis> target

      <title>Reference Field Option</title>

      <para>For a reference using field injection, the reference field option
      defines how SCR must manage the field value. The reference field option
      can have the following values:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><code>replace</code> - SCR must set the field value. Any field
          value set by the constructor of the component instance is
          overwritten. This is the default reference field option.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><code>update</code> - SCR must update the collection set in
          the field. This collection can be set by the constructor of the
          component instance. This reference field option can only be used for
          a dynamic reference with multiple cardinality.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>For a static reference, the replace option must be used.</para>

      <para>For a dynamic reference, the choice of reference field option is
      influenced by the cardinality of the reference. For unary cardinality,
      the replace option must be used. For multiple cardinality, either the
      replace or update option can be used.</para>

      <para>If the update option is used when not permitted, SCR must log an
      error message with the Log Service, if present, and the field must not
      be modified.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Replace Field Option</title>

        <para>If the field is declared with the <code>final</code> modifier,
        SCR must log an error message with the Log Service, if present, and
        the field must not be modified.</para>

        <para>For a static reference, SCR must set the field value before the
        component instance is activated and must not change the field while
        the component is active. This means there is a
        <emphasis>happens-before</emphasis> relationship between setting the
        field and activating the component instance, so the active component
        can safely read the field.</para>

        <para>For a dynamic reference, the field must be declared with the
        <code>volatile</code> modifier so that field value changes made by SCR
        are visible to other threads. If the field is not declared with the
        <code>volatile</code> modifier, SCR must log an error message with the
        Log Service, if present, and the field must not be modified.</para>

        <para>For a reference with unary cardinality, SCR must set the field
        value with initial bound service, if any, before the component
        instance is activated. If the reference has optional cardinality and
        there is no bound service, SCR must set the field value to
        <code>null</code>. If the reference is dynamic, when there is a new
        bound service or the service properties of the bound service are
        modified and the field holds service properties, SCR must replace the
        field value. If the reference has optional cardinality and there is no
        bound service, SCR must set the field value to
        <code>null</code>.</para>

        <para>For a reference with multiple cardinality, the type of the field
        must be <code>Collection</code> or <code>List</code>. If the field has
        a different type, SCR must log an error message with the Log Service,
        if present, and the field must not be modified. Before the component
        instance is activated, SCR must set the field value with a new mutable
        collection that must contain the initial set of bound services sorted
        using an ordering which is the same as the natural ordering of
        <code>ServiceReference</code>s as specified in
        <code>ServiceReference.compareTo</code>. The collection may be empty
        if the reference has optional cardinality and there are no bound
        services. If the reference is dynamic, when there is a change in the
        set of bound services or the service properties of a bound service are
        modified and the collection holds service properties, SCR must replace
        the field value with a new mutable collection that must contain the
        updated set of bound services sorted using an ordering which is the
        same as the natural ordering of <code>ServiceReference</code>s as
        specified in <code>ServiceReference.compareTo</code>. The new
        collection may be empty if the reference has optional cardinality and
        there are no bound services.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Update Field Option</title>

        <para>The update option can only be used for a dynamic reference with
        multiple cardinality. The component's constructor can set the field
        with its choice of collection implementation. In this case, the field
        can be declared with the <code>final</code> modifier. The collection
        implementation used by the component should use identity rather than
        <code>equals</code> or <code>hashCode</code> to manage the elements of
        the collection. The collection implementation should also be
        thread-safe since SCR may update the collection from threads different
        than those used by the component instance.</para>

        <para>After constructing the component instance, if the field value is
        <code>null</code>:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>If the type of the field is <code>Collection</code> or
            <code>List</code>, SCR will set the field value to a new mutable
            empty collection or list object, respectively. If the field is
            declared with the <code>final</code> modifier, SCR must log an
            error message with the Log Service, if present, and the field must
            not be modified.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Otherwise, SCR must log an error message with the Log
            Service, if present, and the field must not be modified.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>SCR must not change the field value while the component is
        active and only update the contents of the collection. SCR must update
        the collection before the component instance is activated by calling
        <code>Collection.add</code> for each bound service. When there is a
        change to the set of bound services:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>SCR must call <code>Collection.add</code> for a newly bound
            service.</para>

    <section xml:id="service.component-selecting.target.services">
      <title>Selecting Target Services</title>

      <para>The target services for a reference are constrained by the
      reference's interface name and target property. By specifying a filter
      in the target property, the programmer and deployer can constrain the
      set of services that should be part of the target services.</para>

      <para>For example, a component wants to track all Component Factory
      services that have a factory identification of
      <code>acme.application</code>. The following component description shows
      how this can be done.</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;scr:component name="example.listen"
    xmlns:scr="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.5.0"&gt;
    &lt;implementation class="com.acme.impl.FactoryTracker"/&gt;
    &lt;reference name="FACTORY"
        interface=
            "org.osgi.service.component.ComponentFactory"
        target="(component.factory=acme.application)"
    /&gt;
&lt;/scr:component&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The filter is manifested as a component property called the
      <emphasis>target property</emphasis>. The target property can also be
      set by <code>property</code> and <code>properties</code> elements, see
      <xref linkend="service.component-property.properties.elements"/>. The
      deployer can also set the target property by establishing a
      configuration for the component which sets the value of the target
      property. This allows the deployer to override the target property in
      the component description. See <xref
      linkend="service.component-target.property"/> for more
      information.</para>

      <section xml:id="service.component-anyservice">
        <title>Any Service Type</title>

        <para>A special exception to the selecting of target services is the
        use of the special interface name
        <code>org.osgi.service.component.AnyService</code>. This means that a
        service type is not used to select the target services and just the
        target property is used to select the target services. When the
        special interface name of
        <code>org.osgi.service.component.AnyService</code> is used, a target
        property must be present to constrain the target services to some
        subset of all available services. If no target property is present,
        SCR must log an error message with the Log Service, if present, and
        the reference cannot be satisfied. Note that there may be performance
        impacts resulting from a target property matching too broad a set of
        target services. A target property of <code>(service.id=*)</code> is
        valid but will match all services in the service registry which will
        likely be neither very useful nor performant.</para>

        <para>The reference member or parameter must have a service type of
        <code>java.lang.Object</code> to allow SCR to provide any service
        object.</para>

        <para>For example, a component wants to track all Jakarta RESTful Web
        Services Extension services. Jakarta RESTful Web Services Extension
        services can be registered under many different service types but must
        be registered with the service property
        <code>osgi.jakartars.extension=true</code>. The following component
        description shows how this can be done.</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;scr:component name="jakartars.extension.listener"
    xmlns:scr="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.5.0"&gt;
    &lt;implementation class="com.acme.impl.ExtensionListener"/&gt;
    &lt;reference name="EXTENSIONS"
        interface=
            "org.osgi.service.component.AnyService"
        target="(osgi.jakartars.extension=true)"
        cardinality="0..n"

    <section xml:id="service.component-circular.references">
      <title>Circular References</title>

      <para>It is possible for a set of component descriptions to create a
      circular dependency. For example, if component <code>A</code> references
      a service provided by component <code>B</code> and component
      <code>B</code> references a service provided by component <code>A</code>
      then a component configuration of one component cannot be satisfied
      without accessing a partially activated component instance of the other
      component. SCR must ensure that a component instance is never accessible
      to another component instance or as a service until it has been fully
      activated, that is it has returned from its <code>activate</code> method
      if it has one.</para>

      <para>Circular references must be detected by SCR when it attempts to
      satisfy component configurations and SCR must fail to satisfy the
      references involved in the cycle and log an error message with the Log
      Service, if present. However, if one of the references in the cycle has
      optional cardinality SCR must break the cycle. The reference with the
      optional cardinality can be satisfied and bound to zero target services.
      Therefore the cycle is broken and the other references may be
      satisfied.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="service.component-logger.support">
      <title>Logger Support</title>

      <para>SCR provides special support for components having references to
      the Logger Factory from the Log Service specification. If the reference
      uses method, field or constructor injection, the referenced service is
      of type <code>org.osgi.service.log.LoggerFactory</code>, and the type of
      the parameter or field to receive the service object is of type
      <code>org.osgi.service.log.Logger</code> or
      <code>org.osgi.service.log.FormatterLogger</code>, then SCR must obtain
      the proper type of Logger from the bound Logger Factory service and use
      the obtained Logger as the service object rather than the service object
      for the bound Logger Factory service.</para>

      <para>To obtain the Logger object to use as the service object, SCR must
      call the <code>LoggerFactory.getLogger(Bundle bundle, String name, Class
      loggerType)</code> method passing the bundle declaring the component as
      the first argument, the fully qualified name of the component
      implementation class as the second argument, and the type of the
      parameter or field, <code>org.osgi.service.log.Logger</code> or
      <code>org.osgi.service.log.FormatterLogger</code>, as the third
      argument.</para>

      <para>For example, the following code will have the <code>logger</code>
      field set to a Logger object created by SCR from the bound Logger
      Factory service.</para>

      <programlisting>@Component
public class MyComponent {
  @Reference(service=LoggerFactory.class)
  private Logger logger;
  @Activate
  void activate(ComponentContext context) {
    logger.trace(“activating component id {}”,
      context.getProperties().get(“component.id”));
  }

    <section xml:id="service.component-satisfying.condition">
      <title>Satisfying Condition</title>

      <para>The <emphasis>Condition Service Specification</emphasis> in <xref
      linkend="intro.core.release" xrefstyle="template:%t"/> defines
      <emphasis>Condition</emphasis> services representing a particular state
      at runtime and requires the OSGi Framework to always register the
      <emphasis>True Condition</emphasis> service.</para>

      <para>Every component description is defined to have a reference to a
      <emphasis>satisfying condition</emphasis>. The name of this reference
      must be <code>osgi.ds.satisfying.condition</code>. If a component
      description does not explicitly declare a reference with the name
      <code>osgi.ds.satisfying.condition</code>, SCR must augment the
      component description to add the following implicit reference as the
      last reference:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;reference name="osgi.ds.satisfying.condition"
    interface="org.osgi.service.condition.Condition"
    target="(osgi.condition.id=true)"
    policy="dynamic"
/&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The implicit reference is handled in the same manner as any
      explicit reference in the component description, including handling
      reference properties. See <xref
      linkend="service.component-reference.properties"/>. In order for a
      component configuration to be satisfied, the reference for the
      satisfying condition, like all other references, must be satisfied. The
      target property for the reference to the satisfying condition,
      <code>osgi.ds.satisfying.condition.target</code>, can be used to select
      the satisfying condition. This allows a component configuration to be
      configured to select which Condition service is the satisfying
      condition. The implicit reference defaults to the target property value
      of <code>(osgi.condition.id=true)</code> which targets the True
      Condition, that is always registered by the OSGi Framework, and thus the
      implicit reference, using the default target property value, can always
      be satisfied.</para>

      <para>For example, you can use the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.component.propertytypes.SatisfyingConditionTarget"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> component property type to set the target
      property for the reference to the satisfying condition to select a
      condition indicating that some subsystem needed by the component is
      ready.</para>

      <programlisting>@Component
@SatisfyingConditionTarget("(osgi.condition.id=my.subsystem.ready)")
public class MyComponent {
  ...
}</programlisting>

      <para>A component's satisfying condition can be used as a way to
      control, via the configuration of component properties, whether a
      component configuration can be satisfied. That is, it can be a way to
      "enable" or "disable" a component configuration through its
      configuration. See <emphasis>Condition Service Specification</emphasis>
      of <xref linkend="intro.core.release" xrefstyle="template:%t"/> for
      additional information on Conditions.</para>

      <para>SCR must support the satisfying condition for all components even
      those with component descriptions in older namespaces.</para>

  <section xml:id="service.component-component.description">
    <title>Component Description</title>

    <para>Component descriptions are defined in XML documents contained in a
    bundle and any attached fragments.</para>

    <para>If SCR detects an error when processing a component description, it
    must log an error message with the Log Service, if present, and ignore the
    component description. Errors can include XML parsing errors and
    ill-formed component descriptions.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Annotations</title>

      <para>A number of <code>CLASS</code> retention annotations have been
      provided to allow tools to construct the component description XML from
      the Java class files. These annotations will be discussed with the
      appropriate elements and attributes. Since the naming rules between XML
      and Java differ, some name changes are necessary.</para>

      <para>Multi-word element and attribute names that use a minus sign
      (<code>'-' \u002D</code>) are changed to camel case. For example, the
      <code>configuration-pid</code> attribute in the <code>component</code>
      element is the <code>configurationPid</code> member in the
      <code>@Component</code> annotation. The annotation class that
      corresponds to an element starts with an upper case letter. For example
      the <code>component</code> element is represented by the
      <code>@Component</code> annotation.</para>

      <para>Some elements do not have a corresponding annotation since the
      annotations can be parameterized by the type information in the Java
      class. For example, the <code>@Component</code> annotation synthesizes
      the <code>implement</code> element's <code>class</code> attribute from
      the type it is applied to.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Service Component Header</title>

      <para>XML documents containing component descriptions must be specified
      by the Service-Component header in the manifest. The value of the header
      is a comma separated list of paths to XML entries within the
      bundle.</para>

      <programlisting>Service-Component ::= header // See Common Header Syntax in Core</programlisting>

      <para>The Service-Component header has no architected directives or
      properties. The header can be left empty.</para>

      <para>The last component of each path in the Service-Component header
      may use wildcards so that <code>Bundle.findEntries</code> can be used to
      locate the XML document within the bundle and its fragments. For
      example:</para>

      <programlisting>Service-Component: OSGI-INF/*.xml</programlisting>

      <para>A Service-Component manifest header specified in a fragment is
      ignored by SCR. However, XML documents referenced by a bundle's
      Service-Component manifest header may be contained in attached
      fragments.</para>

      <para>SCR must process each XML document specified in this header. If an
      XML document specified by the header cannot be located in the bundle and
      its attached fragments, SCR must log an error message with the Log
      Service, if present, and continue.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>XML Document</title>

      <para>A component description must be in a well-formed XML document,
      <xref linkend="i1636361"/>, stored in a <code>UTF-8</code> encoded
      bundle entry. The namespace for component descriptions is:</para>

      <programlisting>http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.5.0</programlisting>

      <para>The recommended prefix for this namespace is <code>scr</code>.
      This prefix is used by examples in this specification. XML documents
      containing component descriptions may contain a single, root
      <code>component</code> element or one or more <code>component</code>
      elements embedded in a larger document. Use of the namespace for
      component descriptions is mandatory. The attributes and sub-elements of
      a <code>component</code> element are always unqualified.</para>

      <para>If an XML document contains a single, root <code>component</code>
      element which does not specify a namespace, then the
      <code>http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.0.0</code> namespace is assumed.
      Component descriptions using the
      <code>http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.0.0</code> namespace must be
      treated according to version 1.0 of this specification.</para>

      <para>SCR must parse all <code>component</code> elements in the
      namespace. Elements not in this namespace must be ignored. Ignoring
      elements that are not recognized allows component descriptions to be
      embedded in any XML document. For example, an entry can provide
      additional information about components. These additional elements are
      parsed by another sub-system.</para>

      <para>See <xref linkend="service.component-schema"/> for component
      description schema.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="service.component-component.element">
      <title>Component Element</title>

      <para>The component element specifies the component description. The
      following text defines the structure of the XML grammar using a form
      that is similar to the normal grammar used in OSGi specifications. In
      this case the grammar should be mapped to XML elements:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;component&gt; ::= (&lt;property&gt; | &lt;properties&gt;)*

      <para>SCR must not require component descriptions to specify the
      elements in the order listed above and as required by the XML schema.
      SCR must allow other orderings since arbitrary orderings of these
      elements do not affect the meaning of the component description. Only
      the relative ordering of <code>property</code> and
      <code>properties</code> elements and of <code>reference</code> elements
      have meaning.</para>

              be unique within a bundle. The component name is used as a PID
              to retrieve component properties from the OSGi Configuration
              Admin service if present, unless a
              <code>configuration-pid</code> attribute has been defined. See
              <xref linkend="service.component-deployment"/> for more
              information. If the component name is used as a PID then it
              should be unique within the framework. The XML schema allows the
              use of component names which are not valid PIDs. Care must be
              taken to use a valid PID for a component name if the component
              should be configured by the Configuration Admin service. This
              attribute is optional. The default value of this attribute is
              the value of the <code>class</code> attribute of the nested
              <code>implementation</code> element. If multiple
              <code>component</code> elements in a bundle use the same value

              <code>implementation</code> element, then using the default

      <title>Enabled</title>

      <para>A component must first be <emphasis>enabled</emphasis> before it
      can be used. A component cannot be enabled unless the component's bundle
      is started. See <emphasis>Starting Bundles</emphasis> in <xref
      linkend="intro.core.release" xrefstyle="template:%t"/>. All components
      in a bundle become disabled when the bundle is stopped. So the life
      cycle of a component is contained within the life cycle of its
      bundle.</para>

      <para>Every component can be enabled or disabled. The initial enabled
      state of a component is specified in the component description via the
      <code>enabled</code> attribute of the <code>component</code> element.
      See <xref linkend="service.component-component.element"/>. Component
      configurations can be created, satisfied and activated only when the
      component is enabled.</para>

      <para>The enabled state of a component can be controlled with the
      Component Context <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.component.ComponentContext.enableComponent-String-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> and <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.component.ComponentContext.disableComponent-String-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> methods. The purpose of later enabling a
      component is to be able to decide programmatically when a component can
      become enabled. For example, an immediate component can perform some
      initialization work before other components in the bundle are enabled.
      The component descriptions of all other components in the bundle can be
      disabled by having <code>enabled</code> set to <code>false</code> in
      their component descriptions. After any necessary initialization work is
      complete, the immediate component can call <code>enableComponent</code>
      to enable the remaining components.</para>

      <para>The <code>enableComponent</code> and <code>disableComponent</code>
      methods must return after changing the enabled state of the named
      component. Any actions that result from this, such as activating or
      deactivating a component configuration, must occur asynchronously to the
      method call. Therefore a component can disable itself.</para>

      <para>All components in a bundle can be enabled by passing a
      <code>null</code> as the argument to
      <code>enableComponent</code>.</para>

      <title>Delayed Component</title>

      <para>A key attribute of a delayed component is the delaying of class
      loading and object creation. Therefore, the activation of a delayed
      component configuration does not occur until there is an actual request
      for a service object. A component is a delayed component when it
      specifies a service but it is not a factory component and does not have
      the <code>immediate</code> attribute of the <code>component</code>
      element set to <code>true</code>.</para>

      <para>SCR must register a service after the component configuration
      becomes satisfied. The registration of this service must look to
      observers of the service registry as if the component's bundle actually
      registered this service. This makes it possible to register services
      without creating a class loader for the bundle and loading classes,
      thereby allowing reduction in initialization time and a delay in memory
      footprint.</para>

      <para>When SCR registers the service on behalf of a component
      configuration, it must avoid causing a class load to occur from the
      component's bundle. SCR can ensure this by registering a
      <code>ServiceFactory</code> object with the Framework for that service.
      By registering a <code>ServiceFactory</code> object, the actual service
      object is not needed until the <code>ServiceFactory</code> is called to
      provide the service object. The service properties for this registration
      consist of the component properties as defined in <xref
      linkend="service.component-service.properties"/>.</para>

      <para>The activation of a component configuration must be delayed until
      its service is requested. When the service is requested, if the service
      has the <code>scope</code> attribute set to <code>bundle</code>, SCR
      must create and activate a unique component configuration for each
      bundle requesting the service. If the service has the <code>scope</code>
      attribute set to <code>prototype</code>, SCR must create and activate a
      unique component configuration for each distinct request for the
      service. Otherwise, if the service has the <code>scope</code> attribute
      set to <code>singleton</code>, SCR must activate a single component
      configuration which is used by all requests for the service. A component
      instance can determine the bundle it was activated for by calling the
      <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.component.ComponentContext.getUsingBundle--"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method on the Component Context.</para>

      <para>The activation of delayed components is depicted in a state
      diagram in <xref linkend="i1462979"/>. Notice that multiple component
      configurations can be created from the <code>REGISTERED</code> state if
      a delayed component specifies a service <code>scope</code> set to a
      value other than <code>singleton</code>.</para>

      <para>If the service has the <code>scope</code> attribute set to
      <code>prototype</code>, SCR must deactivate a component configuration
      when it stops being used as a service object since the component
      configuration must not be reused as a service object. If the service has
      the <code>scope</code> attribute set to <code>singleton</code> or
      <code>bundle</code>, the behavior when a component configuration stops
      being used as a service object depends on the
      <code>retention-policy</code> attribute:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If <code>retention-policy</code> is set to
          <code>discard</code> (the default), SCR must deactivate a component
          configuration when it stops being used as a service object after a
          delay since the component configuration may be reused as a service
          object in the near future. This allows SCR implementations to
          reclaim component configurations not in use while attempting to
          avoid deactivating a component configuration only to have to quickly
          activate a new component configuration for a new service request.
          The delay amount is implementation specific and may be zero.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If <code>retention-policy</code> is set to <code>keep</code>,
          SCR must not deactivate the component configuration when it stops
          being used as a service object. The component configuration remains
          activated and available for reuse. This allows components that are
          expensive to activate or deactivate, or that maintain caches of
          data, to avoid repeated activation cycles. The component
          configuration will still be deactivated if it becomes unsatisfied
          for other reasons, such as required services becoming unavailable,
          configuration being deleted, the component being disabled, or the

      <para>If an active component configuration has a dynamic reference with
      unary cardinality and the bound service is modified or unregistered and
      ceases to be a target service, or the <code>policy-option</code> is
      <code>greedy</code> and a better target service becomes available then
      SCR must attempt to replace the bound service with a new bound
      service.</para>

      <para>If the reference uses field injection, the field must be set for
      the replacement bound service. Then, if the reference uses method
      injection, SCR must first bind the new bound service and then unbind the
      outgoing service. This reversed order allows the component to not have
      to handle the inevitable gap between the unbind and bind methods.
      However, this means that in the unbind method care must be taken to not
      overwrite the newly bound service. For example, the following code
      handles the associated concurrency issues and simplify handling the
      reverse order.</para>

      <title>Reference Properties</title>

      <para>This specification defines some component properties which are
      associated with specific component references. These are called
      <emphasis>reference properties</emphasis>. The name of a reference
      property for a reference is the name of the reference appended with a
      full stop (<code>'.' \u002E</code>) and a suffix unique to the reference
      property. Reference properties can be set wherever component properties
      can be set.</para>

      <para>All component property names starting with a reference name
      followed by a full stop (<code>'.' \u002E</code>) are reserved for use
      by this specification.</para>

      <para>Following are the reference properties defined by this
      specification.</para>

      <section xml:id="service.component-target.property">
        <title>Target Property</title>

        <para>The <emphasis>target property</emphasis> is a reference property
        which aids in the selection of target services for the reference. See
        <xref linkend="service.component-selecting.target.services"/>. The
        name of a target property is the name of a reference appended with
        <code>.target</code>. For example, the target property for a reference
        with the name <code>http</code> would have the name
        <code>http.target</code>. The value of a target property is a filter
        string used to select targets services for the reference.</para>

        <para>The target property for a reference can also be set by the
        <code>target</code> attribute of the <code>reference</code> element.

      <section xml:id="service.component-minimum.cardinality.property">
        <title>Minimum Cardinality Property</title>

        <para>The initial minimum cardinality of a reference is specified by
        the optionality: the first part of the cardinality. It is either
        <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. The minimum cardinality of a
        reference cannot exceed the multiplicity: the second part of the
        cardinality. See <xref
        linkend="service.component-reference.cardinality"/> for more
        information on the cardinality of a reference.</para>

        <para>The <emphasis>minimum cardinality property</emphasis> is a
        reference property which can be used to raise the minimum cardinality
        of a reference from its initial value. That is, a <code>0..1</code>
        cardinality can be raised to a <code>1..1</code> cardinality by
        setting the reference's minimum cardinality property to
        <code>1</code>, and a <code>0..n</code> or <code>1..n</code>
        cardinality can be raised to a <code>m..n</code> cardinality by
        setting the reference's minimum cardinality property to <code>m</code>
        such that <code>m</code> is a positive integer. The minimum
        cardinality of a reference cannot be lowered. That is, a
        <code>1..1</code> or <code>1..n</code> cardinality cannot be lowered
        to a <code>0..1</code> or <code>0..n</code> cardinality because the
        component was coded to expect at least one bound service.</para>

        <para>The name of a minimum cardinality property is the name of a
        reference appended with <code>.cardinality.minimum</code>. For
        example, the minimum cardinality property for a reference with the
        name <code>http</code> would have the name
        <code>http.cardinality.minimum</code>. The value of a minimum
        cardinality property must be a positive integer or a value that can be
        coerced into a positive integer. See <xref
        linkend="service.component-component.property.value.coercion"/> for
        information on coercing property values. If the numerical value of the
        minimum cardinality property is not valid for the reference's
        cardinality or the minimum cardinality property value cannot be
        coerced into a numerical value, then the minimum cardinality property
        must be ignored.</para>

        <para>SCR must support the minimum cardinality property for all
        components even those with component descriptions in older
        namespaces.</para>

  <section xml:id="service.component-deployment">
    <title>Deployment</title>

    <para>A component description contains default information to select
    target services for each reference. However, when a component is deployed,
    it is often necessary to influence the target service selection in a way
    that suits the needs of the deployer. Therefore, SCR uses
    <code>Configuration</code> objects from Configuration Admin to replace and
    extend the component properties for a component configuration. That is,
    through Configuration Admin, a deployer can configure component
    properties.</para>

    <para>A component's configuration PIDs are used as keys for obtaining
    additional component properties from Configuration Admin. When
    <emphasis>matching</emphasis> a configuration PID to a
    <code>Configuration</code> object, SCR must use the
    <code>Configuration</code> object with the best matching PID for the
    component's bundle. See <xref linkend="service.cm-targeted.pids"/> for
    more information on targeted PIDs and <xref
    linkend="service.cm-extenders.targeted.pids"/> for more information on
    selecting the <code>Configuration</code> object with the best matching
    PID.</para>

    <para>The following situations can arise when looking for
    <code>Configuration</code> objects:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>No Configuration</emphasis> - If the component's
        <code>configuration-policy</code> is set to <code>ignore</code> or
        there are no Configurations with a PID or factory PID matching any of
        the configuration PIDs, then component configurations will not obtain
        component properties from Configuration Admin. Only component
        properties specified in the component description or via the
        <code>ComponentFactory.newInstance</code> method will be used.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Not Satisfied</emphasis> - If the component's
        <code>configuration-policy</code> is set to <code>require</code> and,
        for each configuration PID, there is no Configuration with a matching
        PID or factory PID, then the component configuration is not satisfied
        and will not be activated.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Single Configuration</emphasis> - If none of the
        configuration PIDs matches a factory PID, then component
        configurations will obtain additional component properties from
        Configuration Admin.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Factory Configuration</emphasis> - If one of the
        configuration PIDs matches a factory PID, with zero or more
        Configurations, then for each Configuration of the factory PID, a
        component configuration must be created that will obtain additional
        component properties from Configuration Admin.</para>

        <para>It is a configuration error if more than one of the
        configuration PIDs match a factory PID and SCR must log an error
        message with the Log Service, if present. If the
        <code>configuration-policy</code> is set to <code>optional</code>, the
        component configuration must be satisfied without the configurations
        PIDs which match a factory PID. If the
        <code>configuration-policy</code> is set to <code>require</code>, the
        component configuration is not satisfied and will not be
        activated.</para>

        <para>A factory configuration must not be used if the component is a
        factory component. This is because SCR is not free to create component
        configurations as necessary to support multiple Configurations. When
        SCR detects this condition, it must log an error message with the Log
        Service, if present, and ignore the component description.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>SCR must obtain the <code>Configuration</code> objects from the
    Configuration Admin service using the Bundle Context of the bundle
    containing the component. SCR must only use <code>Configuration</code>
    objects for which the bundle containing the component has visibility. See
    <xref linkend="service.cm-location.binding"/>.</para>

    <para>To ensure Configuration Plugins can participate in the configuration
    process, SCR must use the
    <code>Configuration.getProcessedProperties</code> method when obtaining
    the configuration data from a <code>Configuration</code> object. To use
    the <code>getProcessedProperties</code> method, SCR must supply a Service
    Reference for a <code>ManagedService</code> or
    <code>ManagedServiceFactory</code> service. The
    <code>ManagedService</code> or <code>ManageServiceFactory</code> service
    must be registered using the Bundle Context of the bundle containing the
    component. If SCR registers one of these services for the purpose of using
    the service's Service Reference for the call to
    <code>getProcessedProperties</code>, SCR should register the service
    without a <code>service.pid</code> service property so that the service
    itself is not called by Configuration Admin.</para>

    <para>For example, there is a component named <code>com.acme.client</code>
    with a reference named <code>HTTP</code> that requires an Http Service
    which must be bound to a component <code>com.acme.httpserver</code> which
    provides an Http Service. A deployer can establish the following
    configuration:</para>

    <programlisting>[PID=com.acme.client, factoryPID=null]
HTTP.target = (component.name=com.acme.httpserver)</programlisting>

    <section xml:id="service.component-configuration.changes">
      <title>Configuration Changes</title>

      <para>SCR must track changes in the <code>Configuration</code> objects
      matching the configuration PIDs of a component description. Changes
      include the creating, updating and deleting of
      <code>Configuration</code> objects matching the configuration PIDs. The
      actions SCR must take when a configuration change for a component
      configuration occurs are based upon how the
      <code>configuration-policy</code> and <code>modified</code> attributes
      are specified in the component description, whether a component
      configuration becomes satisfied, remains satisfied or becomes
      unsatisfied and the type and number of matching
      <code>Configuration</code> objects.</para>

      <para>With targeted PIDs, multiple <code>Configuration</code> objects
      can exist which can match a configuration PID. Creation of a
      <code>Configuration</code> object with a better matching PID than a
      <code>Configuration</code> object currently being used by a component
      configuration results in a configuration change for the component
      configuration with the new <code>Configuration</code> object replacing
      the currently used <code>Configuration</code> object. Deletion of a
      <code>Configuration</code> object currently being used by a component
      configuration when there is another <code>Configuration</code> object
      matching the configuration PID also results in a configuration change
      for the component configuration with the <code>Configuration</code>
      object having the best matching PID replacing the currently used, and
      now deleted, <code>Configuration</code> object.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Ignore Configuration Policy</title>

        <para>For <code>configuration-policy</code> of <code>ignore</code>,
        component configurations are unaffected by configuration changes since
        the component properties do not include properties from
        <code>Configuration</code> objects.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Require Configuration Policy</title>

        <para>For <code>configuration-policy</code> of <code>require</code>,
        component configurations require a <code>Configuration</code> object
        for each specified configuration PID. With a factory configuration,
        there can be zero or more matching <code>Configuration</code> objects
        which will result in a component configuration for each
        <code>Configuration</code> object of the factory configuration. With a
        factory component, multiple component configurations can be created
        all using the matching <code>Configuration</code> objects.</para>

        <para>A configuration change can cause a component configuration to
        become unsatisfied if any of the following occur:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>

        </itemizedlist>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Optional Configuration Policy</title>

        <para>For <code>configuration-policy</code> of <code>optional</code>,
        component configurations do not require <code>Configuration</code>
        objects. Since matching <code>Configuration</code> objects are
        optional, component configurations can be satisfied with zero or more
        matched configuration PIDs. If a <code>Configuration</code> object is
        then created which matches a configuration PID, this is a
        configuration change for the component configurations that are not
        using the created <code>Configuration</code> object. If a
        <code>Configuration</code> object is deleted which matches a
        configuration PID, this is a configuration change for the component
        configurations using the deleted <code>Configuration</code>
        object.</para>

        <para>Furthermore, with a factory configuration matching a
        configuration PID, the factory configuration can provide zero or more
        <code>Configuration</code> objects which will result in a component
        configuration for each <code>Configuration</code> object or a single
        component configuration when zero matching <code>Configuration</code>
        objects are provided. With a factory component, multiple component
        configurations can be created all using the <code>Configuration</code>
        objects matching the configuration PIDs.</para>

    <title>Annotations</title>

    <para>A number of <code>CLASS</code> retention annotations have been

    the Java class files. The Component Annotations are intended to be used
    during build time to generate the component description XML.</para>

    <para>Component Property Types, which are user defined annotations, can be

    manner.</para>

    <section xml:id="service.component-component.annotations">
      <title>Component Annotations</title>

      <para>The Component Annotations provide a convenient way to create the
      component description XML during build time. Since annotations are
      placed in the source file and can use types, fields, and methods, they
      can significantly simplify the use of Declarative Services.</para>

      <para>The Component Annotations are build time annotations because one
      of the key aspects of Declarative Services is its laziness. SCR can
      easily read the component description XML from the bundle, preprocess
      it, and cache the results between framework invocations. This way it is
      unnecessary to load a class from the bundle when the bundle is started
      and/or scan the classes for annotations. Component Annotations are not
      recognized by SCR at runtime.</para>

      <para>The Component Annotations are not inherited, they can only be used
      on a given class, annotations on its super class hierarchy or interfaces
      are not taken into account.</para>

      <para>The primary annotation is the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Component"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> annotation. It indicates that a class is a

      <para>The previous example would be processed at build time into a

@Activate
public MacSpeech(Map&lt;String,?&gt; properties) { ... }</programlisting>

      <title>Component Property Types</title>

      <para>Component properties can be defined and accessed through a user
      defined annotation type, called a <emphasis>component property
      type</emphasis>, containing the property names, property types and
      default values. A component property type allows properties to be
      defined and accessed in a type safe manner. Component property types can
      themselves be annotated with the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.component.annotations.ComponentPropertyType"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> meta-annotation.</para>

      <para>The following example shows the definition of a component property
      type called <code>Config</code> which defines three properties where the
      name of the property is the name of the method, the type of the property
      is the return type of the method and the default value for the property
      is the default value of the method.</para>

      <programlisting>@ComponentPropertyType
public @interface Config {
  boolean enabled() default true;
  String[] names() default {"a", "b"};
  String topic() default "default/topic";
}</programlisting>

      <para>Component property types can be used in two ways:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Component property types can be used to annotate the
            component implementation class, along side the <xref
            linkend="org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Component"
            xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> annotation. The annotation usage can
            specify property values which can be different than the default
            values declared in the component property type.</para>

            <para>To be used in this way, the component property type must be
            annotated with the <xref
            linkend="org.osgi.service.component.annotations.ComponentPropertyType"
            xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> meta-annotation so that, at build time,
            the annotation is recognized as a component property type.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Component property types can be used as parameter types in
            the component's constructor and life cycle methods, or as field
            types for activation fields. The component implementation can use
            objects of a component property type at runtime to access
            component property values in a type safe manner.</para>

            <para>To be used in this way, it is recommended the component
            property type be annotated with the <xref
            linkend="org.osgi.service.component.annotations.ComponentPropertyType"
            xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> meta-annotation but it is not
            required.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>Both ways define property names, types and values for the
      component.</para>

      <para>The following example shows the component implementation annotated
      with the example <code>Config</code> component property type which
      specifies a property value for the component which is different than the
      default value. The example also shows the activate method taking the
      example <code>Config</code> component property type as a parameter type
      and the method implementation accesses component property values by
      invoking methods on the component property type object.</para>

      <programlisting>@Component
@Config(names="myapp")
public class MyComponent {
  @Activate
  void activate(Config config) {
    if (config.enabled()) {
      // do something
    }
    for (String name:config.names()) {
      // do something with each name
    }
  }
}</programlisting>

      <para>If a component implementation needs to access component properties
      which are not represented by a component property type, it can use a
      type of Map to receive the properties map in addition to component
      property types. For example:</para>

      <programlisting>@Component
public class MyComponent {
  @Activate
  void activate(Config config, Map&lt;String, ?&gt; allProperties) {
    if (config.enabled()) {
      // do something
    }
    if (allProperties.get("other.prop") != null) {
      // do something
    }
  }
}</programlisting>

      <para>Component property types must be defined as annotation types. This
      is done for several reasons. First, the limitations on annotation type
      definitions make them well suited for component property types. The
      methods must have no parameters and the return types supported are
      limited to a set which is well suited for component properties. Second,
      annotation types support default values which is useful for defining the
      default value of a component property. Finally, as annotations, they can
      be used to annotate component implementation classes.</para>

      <para>At build time, the component property types must be processed to
      potentially generate <code>property</code> elements in the component
      description. See <xref
      linkend="service.component-ordering.generated.properties"/>.</para>

      <para>At runtime, when SCR needs to provide a component instance an
      activation object whose type is a component property type, SCR must
      construct an instance of the component property type whose methods are
      backed by the values of the component properties for the component
      instance. This object can then be used to obtain the property values in
      a type safe manner.</para>

      <section xml:id="service.component-component.property.mapping">
        <title>Component Property Mapping</title>

        <para>Each method of a configuration property type is mapped to a

        Certain common property name characters, such as full stop (<code>'.'

      <title>Starting and Stopping SCR</title>

      <para>When SCR is implemented as a bundle, any component configurations
      activated by SCR must be deactivated when the SCR bundle is stopped.
      When the SCR bundle is started, it must process any components that are
      declared in bundles that are started. This includes bundles which are
      started and are awaiting lazy activation.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Logging Messages</title>

      <para>When SCR must log a message to the Log Service, it must use a
      Logger named for the component implementation class and associated with
      the bundle declaring the component. To obtain the Logger object, SCR
      must call the <code>LoggerFactory.getLogger(Bundle bundle, String name,
      Class loggerType)</code> method passing the bundle declaring the
      component as the first argument and the fully qualified name of the
      component implementation class as the second argument. If SCR cannot
      know the component implementation class name, because the error is not
      associated with a component or the error occurred before the component
      description is processed, then SCR must use the bundle's Root Logger,
      that is, the Logger named <code>ROOT</code>.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="service.component-locating.members">
      <title>Locating Component Methods and Fields</title>

      <para>SCR will need to locate activate, deactivate, modified, bind,
      updated, and unbind methods as well as fields in a component instance.
      These members will be located, and called or modified, using reflection.
      The declared members of each class in the component implementation
      class's hierarchy are examined for a suitable member. If a suitable
      member is found in a class, and it is accessible to the component
      implementation class, then that member must be used. If suitable members
      are found in a class but none of the suitable members are accessible by
      the component implementation class, then the search for suitable members
      terminates with no suitable member having been located. If no suitable
      members are found in a class, the search continues in the
      superclass.</para>

      <para>Only members that are accessible to the component implementation
      class will be used. If the member has the <code>public</code> or
      <code>protected</code> access modifier, then access is permitted.
      Otherwise, if the member has the <code>private</code> access modifier,
      then access is permitted only if the member is declared in the component
      implementation class. Otherwise, if the member has default access, also
      known as package private access, then access is permitted only if the
      member is declared in the component implementation class or if the
      member is declared in a superclass and all classes in the hierarchy from
      the component implementation class to the superclass, inclusive, are in
      the same package and loaded by the same class loader.</para>

      <para>It is recommended that these members should not be declared with
      the <code>public</code> access modifier so that they do not appear as
      public members on the component instance when it is used as a service
      object. Having these members declared <code>public</code> allows any
      code to call or access the members with reflection, even if a Security
      Manager is installed. These members are generally intended to only be
      called or modified by SCR.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Bundle Activator Interaction</title>

      <para>A bundle containing components may also declare a Bundle
      Activator. Such a bundle may also be marked for lazy activation. Since
      components are activated by SCR and Bundle Activators are called by the
      OSGi Framework, a bundle using both components and a Bundle Activator
      must take care. The Bundle Activator's start method must not rely upon
      SCR having activated any of the bundle's components. However, the
      components can rely upon the Bundle Activator's start method having been
      called. That is, there is a <emphasis>happens-before</emphasis>
      relationship between the Bundle Activator's start method being run and
      the components being activated.</para>

      <para>The two main DTOs are <xref

    </section>

    <section xml:id="service.component-locating.true.condition">
      <title>Locating the True Condition Service</title>

      <para>SCR must locate the True Condition service. This can be done using
      the Bundle Context of SCR itself. However, if SCR is unable to locate
      the True Condition service using the Bundle Context of SCR itself, it
      may retry using the Bundle Context of the system bundle. This retry to
      locate the True Condition service can succeed when a service hook
      implementation is in use that has not been updated to support the
      Condition Service Specification by providing visibility of the True
      Condition service to all bundles.</para>

      <para>If SCR is unable to locate the True Condition service, which can
      occur if SCR is running on an older OSGi Framework which does not
      support the Condition Service Specification and register the True
      Condition service, then SCR must not augment component descriptions to
      add the implicit reference for a satisfying condition. See <xref
      linkend="service.component-satisfying.condition"/>.</para>

      <para>SCR may use the already located True Condition service to satisfy
      any component configuration's reference to the True Condition
      service.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Security</title>

    <para>When Java permissions are enabled, SCR must perform the following
    security procedures.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Service Permissions</title>

      <para>Declarative services are built upon the existing OSGi service
      infrastructure. This means that Service Permission applies regarding the
      ability to publish, find or bind services.</para>

      <para>If a component specifies a service, then component configurations
      for the component cannot be satisfied unless the component's bundle has
      <code>ServicePermission[&lt;provides&gt;, REGISTER]</code> for each
      provided interface specified for the service.</para>

      <para>If a component's reference does not specify optional cardinality,
      the reference cannot be satisfied unless the component's bundle has
      <code>ServicePermission[&lt;interface&gt;, GET]</code> for the specified
      interface in the reference. If the reference specifies optional
      cardinality but the component's bundle does not have
      <code>ServicePermission[&lt;interface&gt;, GET]</code> for the specified
      interface in the reference, no service must be bound for this
      reference.</para>

      <para>If a component is a factory component, then the above Service
      Permission checks still apply. But the component's bundle is not
      required to have <code>ServicePermission[ComponentFactory,
      REGISTER]</code> as the Component Factory service is registered by
      SCR.</para>

      <para>SCR must have <code>ServicePermission[ServiceComponentRuntime,
      REGISTER]</code> permission to register the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.component.runtime.ServiceComponentRuntime"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> service. Administrative bundles wishing to use
      the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.component.runtime.ServiceComponentRuntime"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> service must have
      <code>ServicePermission[ServiceComponentRuntime, GET]</code> permission.
      In general, this permission should only be granted to administrative
      bundles to limit access to the potentially intrusive methods provided by
      this service.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Required Admin Permission</title>

      <para>SCR requires <code>AdminPermission[*,CONTEXT]</code> because it
      needs access to the bundle's Bundle Context object with the
      <code>Bundle.getBundleContext()</code> method.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Using hasPermission</title>

      <para>SCR does all publishing, finding and binding of services on behalf
      of the component using the Bundle Context of the component's bundle.
      This means that normal stack-based permission checks will check SCR and
      not the component's bundle. Since SCR is registering and getting
      services on behalf of a component's bundle, SCR must call the
      <code>Bundle.hasPermission</code> method to validate that a component's
      bundle has the necessary permission to register or get a service.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="service.component-multi.location.regions">
      <title>Configuration Multi-Locations and Regions</title>

      <para>SCR must ensure a bundle has the proper
      <code>ConfigurationPermission</code> for a Configuration used by its
      components when the Configuration has a multi-location. See <xref
      linkend="service.cm-multi.locations"/> for more information on
      multi-locations and <xref linkend="service.cm-regions"/> for more
      information on regions. If a bundle does not have the necessary
      permission for a multi-location Configuration, then SCR must act as if
      the Configuration does not exist for the bundle.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="service.component-schema">
    <title>Component Description Schema</title>

    <para>This XML Schema defines the component description grammar.</para>

    <programlisting role="pgwide"><xi:include encoding="utf-8"
        href="../../generated/xmlns/scr/v1.5.0/scr.xsd" parse="text"/></programlisting>

    <para>SCR must not require component descriptions to specify the elements
    in the order required by the schema. SCR must allow other orderings since
    arbitrary orderings of these elements do not affect the meaning of the
    component description. Only the relative ordering of
    <code>property</code>, <code>properties</code> and <code>reference</code>
    elements have meaning for overriding previously set property
    values.</para>

    <para>The schema is also available in digital form from <xref
    linkend="i1655737"/>.</para>

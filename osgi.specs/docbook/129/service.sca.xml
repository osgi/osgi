    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The <xref linkend="i3072184"/> provides an assembly model for
    distributed applications and systems using a service oriented
    architecture. The components that are assembled can be written in
    different technologies for example Java EE, BPEL, C++, and scripting
    languages. They can execute on different machines, and can communicate
    through different protocols and technologies. For example SOAP/HTTP as
    well as JMS and JCA. SCA enables the precise configuration of the
    communications between its components allowing the configuration to be
    deployed to different SCA runtimes without change. SCA enables
    interoperability when used with interoperable protocols, such as
    HTTP.</para>

    <para>The OSGi Remote Services model, which is based on the chapter about
    <xref linkend="service.remoteservices"/>, describes how to distribute OSGi
    services in general. The Remote Services specification provides an
    extendable model for configuration types, enabling the use of a wide array
    of technologies. This SCA Configuration Type Specification defines such a
    configuration type. It provides a mapping of the SCA distribution
    configuration to the OSGi Remote Services model, as well as the Remote
    Service Admin Endpoint Description, thus enabling OSGi runtimes to be
    configured for portability and interoperability.</para>

    <para>This specification is based on the <xref linkend="i3072278"/> and
    <xref linkend="i3072399"/>.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Synopsis</title>

      <para>Endpoints are created using metadata descriptions, the SCA
      Configuration, that are typed by the SCA specifications. This
      configuration defines the Bindings and policy information used to
      configure an exported Endpoint or describe the Endpoint to an importing
      framework. SCA Configurations can be installed into a framework through
      an <emphasis>SCA Configuration Bundle</emphasis>. An SCA Configuration
      Bundle is a bundle containing one or more SCA Configuration Documents.
      The Distribution Provider manages an internal registry based on these
      SCA Configurations. The internal registry is representing a view on the
      SCA domain; clusters of computers can potentially share this internal
      registry. However, the life cycle of the information in this registry is
      tied to the life cycle of the bundle that provides the SCA
      Configuration.</para>

      <para>A Distribution Provider is responsible for managing remote
      services; remote services can be exported and imported. For exporting a
      service, an Endpoint can be created when the following criteria are met
      on an active service:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Ready</emphasis> - A service is registered and
          satisfies the rules necessary for it to be considered available for
          exporting.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Configured</emphasis> - The configuration the
          service refers to in its properties, both directly and indirectly,
          is available, correct, and complete.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The satisfaction of these criteria can change over time, for
      example, due to new SCA Configuration Bundles becoming ready, being
      uninstalled, services being registered, services being unregistered, or
      having their configuration changed. The Distribution Provider is
      responsible for tracking all such changes and managing the Endpoint life
      cycle of an exported service accordingly.</para>

      <para>A Remote Service Admin service can also import Endpoints that are
      configured with the SCA Configuration Type. An SCA Distribution Provider
      must be able to import such a service.</para>

  <section>
    <title>SCA Overview</title>

    <para>The Service Component Architecture (SCA) is a programming model for
    assembling applications and systems using a <emphasis>service oriented
    architecture</emphasis>. The specifications for SCA are developed at <xref
    linkend="i3074222"/>. The core SCA specification is the <xref
    linkend="i3072278"/> that defines how components of different
    implementation technologies, such as Java EE, BPEL, and scripting
    languages, can be assembled and deployed.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Bindings and Binding Types</title>

      <para>To assist the deployment, the assembly contains XML descriptions
      of the required topology. An important aspect of this description is the
      <emphasis>Binding</emphasis>. A Binding provides the details of an
      Endpoint. Bindings can be attached to SCA services or SCA references
      (dependencies) of the assembled components in order to enable
      communications. For example, an RMI Binding would need the server and
      port number of an RMI Registry.</para>

      <para>Binding details vary significantly per protocol. This is the
      reason that the SCA model recognizes <emphasis>Binding Types</emphasis>.
      A Binding Type is defined as an XML Schema type in an XML namespace.
      Such a type must be substitutable for the <code>sca:binding</code>
      element. Vendors can also define Binding Types that are not specified by
      SCA. For example, a Binding Type for RMI authored by the ACME company
      could look like:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; 
&lt;schema xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
   xmlns:sca="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/opencsa/sca/200912"
   xmlns:acme="http://acme.com/defs" &gt; 
   targetNamespace="http://acme.com/defs"&gt;  

   &lt;element name="binding.rmi" type="RMIBinding" 
      substitutionGroup="sca:binding"/&gt; 

   &lt;complexType name="RMIBinding"&gt; 
     &lt;complexContent&gt;
       &lt;extension base="sca:Binding"&gt; 
         &lt;attribute name="host" type="string" use="required"/&gt; 
         &lt;attribute name="port" type="string" use="optional"/&gt; 
       &lt;/extension&gt; 
     &lt;/complexContent&gt; 
   &lt;/complexType&gt; 
&lt;/schema&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The details for a Binding are therefore configured in an element
      of a specific Binding Type. The Binding Type <code>sca:binding.ws</code>
      is quite common; this type defines the configuration for a web service.
      Therefore, an <code>sca:binding.ws</code> element details the
      particulars for a concrete web services Binding.</para>

      <para>A set of standard Binding Types are specified in SCA for web
      services, JMS, EJB, and JCA. All these bindings are optional for
      implementations of SCA. Any Binding Type must be supported by the
      run-time on which an assembly is deployed.</para>

      <para>Though Bindings provide the primary details of a Communication
      Stack, there are usually many options for a particular service to
      define. SCA specifies a <emphasis>Policy Framework</emphasis> that
      allows constraints, capabilities and quality requirements to be
      described for such a service.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="i3074543">
      <title>Policy Framework</title>

      <para>The SCA policy framework is defined with
      <emphasis>Intents</emphasis> and <emphasis>Policy
      Sets</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>Intents give a name to abstract concepts such as
      <code>integrity</code> and <code>confidentiality</code>. The indirection
      of Intents allows the authors of services to specify their abstract
      communications requirements and not be concerned how these requirements
      are actually implemented. These Intents must then be satisfied by the
      deployer with a specific <emphasis>implementation</emphasis>. For
      example, a service author could have specified the
      <code>confidentiality</code> Intent which is then provided by the
      deployer by ensuring that the communications are encrypted with the
      <code>Blowfish</code> encryption algorithm, using a 442 bits key.</para>

      <para>Intents can be suffixed with a full stop (<code>'.' \u002E</code>)
      and a <emphasis>qualifier</emphasis> to create a <emphasis>qualified
      Intent</emphasis>. For example, <code>integrity.message</code> qualifies
      the <code>integrity</code> Intent.</para>

      <para>Qualifiers have only one level and there must always be one
      qualifier that is the <emphasis>default qualifier</emphasis>. A service
      author that requires an Intent can be satisfied by a Distribution
      Provider that provides that Intent or any of its qualified forms. That
      is, requiring the <code>SOAP</code> Intent on an exported service is
      satisfied by the <code>SOAP.v1_2</code> qualified Intent of a
      Distribution Provider. Providing a qualified Intent implies all the
      semantics of its unqualified Intent. Requiring a qualified Intent can
      only be satisfied with that specific qualified Intent. Each Intent can
      mark one qualified Intent as its default, if only one qualified Intent
      is specified then this is the default. The default qualified Intent is
      used to resolve a choice when no other information is available. For
      example, the <code>SOAP</code> intent could mark the <code>v1_2</code>
      qualifier as default. In such a case, a Distribution Provider must use
      the <code>SOAP.v1_2</code> qualified Intent, even though an exported
      service only required the SOAP Intent.</para>

      <para>Intents can also be grouped in <emphasis>profile
      Intent</emphasis>s.</para>

      <para>A Binding Type can state Intents that it inherently provides. For
      example, a web service Binding inherently provides the <code>SOAP</code>
      Intent. An instance of a Binding Type, a <emphasis>Binding</emphasis>,
      can configure requirements for additional Intents. This allows the
      Binding to configure-in additional aspects of the communications that
      were not inherently provided by the Binding Type, or the Intents
      required by the service. For example, a Binding could add the
      <code>confidentiality</code> Intent.</para>

      <para>The <emphasis>implementation</emphasis> of an Intent is provided
      by a <emphasis>Policy Set</emphasis>. A Policy Set uses a policy
      language to define this implementation. A Policy Set can apply to all
      Binding Types or it can apply to a specific Binding Type. For example,
      an SCA service could be configured with the SCA web services Binding
      (<code>binding. ws</code> element) and the <code>confidentiality</code>
      Intent. A Policy Set that matches the tuple <code>(confidentiality,
      binding.ws)</code> then defines that the implementation is the
      <code>Triple-DES</code> encryption algorithm.</para>

      <para>SCA provides a mechanism to define Policy Sets
      using standard policy languages, such as the <xref
      linkend="i3073536"/>.</para>

      <para>In order for a service to be correctly configured, the
      relationships between Intents, Bindings and Policy Sets must be
      consistent. For example, a Policy Set could state that it provides the
      <code>confidentiality</code> Intent and applies to the
      <code>binding.ws</code> Binding. However, if the Intent does not also
      state it applies to the web service Binding then the relationships do
      not match and the configuration is invalid or incomplete.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Relationships</title>

      <para>Intents and Policy Sets are configured in the <code>intent</code>
      and <code>policySet</code> elements as well as the elements and
      attributes defined by the Binding Types. <xref linkend="i3089579"/>
      shows these elements and XML Schema Type from the SCA Policy Framework
      that are applicable to this specification. The relationships between
      these elements and types are described in <xref
      linkend="service.sca-policy.framework.relationships"/>. The
      relationships in <xref linkend="i3089579"/> and <xref
      linkend="service.sca-policy.framework.relationships"/> are named after
      their corresponding element or attribute in the SCA Schema.</para>

    <title>SCA Configuration Bundles</title>

    <para>An OSGi Distribution Provider that supports SCA configuration types
    must track <emphasis>SCA Configuration Bundles</emphasis>. These are
    bundles that are marked to have <emphasis>SCA Configuration
    Documents</emphasis>, this detection is explained in <xref
    linkend="i3102952"/>. If such an SCA Configuration Bundle is found, then
    its resources are parsed as SCA Configuration Documents and, when found to
    be correct, their configuration placed in an <emphasis>internal
    registry</emphasis>. This internal registry contains the defined Bindings,
    Intents, and Policy Sets indexed by their names. The Intents, Policy Sets,
    and Bindings are then available for bundles that want to export or import
    services. If the SCA Configuration Bundle is stopped, the internal
    registry must be purged from any of the information that was derived from
    the bundle's resources.</para>

    <para>For example, if an SCA Configuration Bundle defines the
    <code>acme:FooRMI</code> Binding together with the
    <code>acme:protected</code> Intent, then the following service properties
    could be used to export a service:</para>

    <programlisting>service.exported.configs = org.osgi.sca
org.osgi.sca.bindings    = FooRMI
service.exported.intents = protected</programlisting>

    <section xml:id="i3112147">
      <title>Naming</title>

      <para>Service properties can export a service with a qualified name or
      the short name for Bindings and Intents. These names have the following
      structure:</para>

      <programlisting>name ::= NCName | QName</programlisting>

      <para>Both <code>QName</code> and <code>NCName</code> are defined by
      <xref linkend="i3102308"/>. The structure for a <code>QName</code>
      is:</para>

      <programlisting>QName ::= '{' &lt;namespace&gt; '}' NCName</programlisting>

      <para>Spaces are not allowed in a <code>name</code>.</para>

      <para>For example, a new Intent named <code>protected</code>, defined in
      an SCA Configuration Resource and a <code>targetNamespace</code> of
      <code>http://acme.com</code>, would be identifiable through the
      qualified name:</para>

      <programlisting>{http://acme.com}protected</programlisting>

      <para>There is no specific support for versioning. A name defined in a
      namespace must be treated as identical if it appears in multiple
      documents. Namespaces can implement versioning by suffixing the
      namespace with a version number.</para>

          <para><emphasis>Intent Vocabulary</emphasis> - The vocabulary of the

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The internal registry must maintain the items by their qualified

      no requirement that the internal registry is internally consistent nor
      <emphasis>complete</emphasis> (see <xref linkend="i3106449"/> ) at all
      times. Duplicate qualified names for the same type are, however, never
      allowed. It is legal to refer to names that have not been defined,
      however, such referrers cannot be used in configuration types until they
      are complete.</para>

      <para>The Internal SCA Registry should, at any moment in time, only
      contain the error-free definitions of ready SCA Configuration Bundles.
      Due to the asynchronous nature of processing the definitions, it is

      <title>Detection of SCA Configuration Bundles</title>

      <para>A bundle is an <emphasis>SCA Configuration Bundle</emphasis> if
      its manifest contains an SCA-Configuration header and it has one or more
      SCA Configuration Documents. The structure of an SCA Configuration
      Document is defined in <xref linkend="i3101906"/>. A Distribution
      Provider is responsible for obtaining and releasing configurations based
      on the bundle life cycle of SCA Configuration Bundles.</para>

      <para>The SCA-Configuration header has the following syntax:</para>

      <programlisting>SCA-Configuration ::= header     // See Common Header Syntax in Core</programlisting>

      <para>If the header is present, but no value is provided, then its
      default value is:</para>

      <programlisting>OSGI-INF/sca-config/*.xml</programlisting>

      <para>This specification does not define any attributes or directives
      for this header, implementations of this specification must ignore
      unrecognized attributes and directives. Implementations can provide
      proprietary parameters that should be registered with the OSGi Alliance
      to prevent name collisions. The non-localized version of the
      SCA-Configuration header must be used.</para>

      <para>The last component of each path in the SCA-Configuration clauses
      may use wildcards so that the <code>Bundle</code>
      <code>findEntries</code> method can be used to locate the SCA
      Configuration resource within the bundle and its fragments. The
      <code>findEndtries</code> method must always be used in the
      non-recursive mode. Valid paths in the header have one of the following
      forms:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Absolute path</emphasis> - The path to a resource in
          the fragment or directory, this resource must exist. For example
          <code>cnf/start.xml</code>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Directory</emphasis> - The path to directory in a
          fragment or the bundle's JAR; the path must end in a solidus
          (<code>'/' \u002F</code>). The pattern used in the
          <code>findEntries</code> method must then be <code>*.xml</code>. The
          directory is allowed to be empty.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Pattern</emphasis> - The last component of the path
          specifies a resource name with optional wildcards. The part before
          is the path of a directory in the bundle or one of its fragments.
          These two parts specify the parameter to the
          <code>findEntries</code> method. It is allowed to have no matching
          resources. An example of a pattern is:
          <code>cnf/*.xml</code>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>If the SCA-Configuration header is not present, then the bundle
      must not be searched for SCA Configuration Documents. An
      SCA-Configuration manifest header specified in a fragment must be
      ignored by the Distribution Provider.</para>

      <para>If no SCA Configuration Documents can be found, then the SCA
      Configuration Bundle is ignored for the purpose of SCA Configuration
      data. SCA Configuration Documents referenced by an SCA-Configuration
      manifest header, or its default, may be contained in attached fragments;
      this is the normal mode for the <code>findEntries</code> method.</para>

      <para>For example, the following header will read the resources
      <code>/bindings/acme.xml</code>, <code>policy/security.xml</code>, and
      all resources whose path ends in <code>.xml</code> in the

      <title>Example SCA Configuration</title>

      <para>The following example shows an extract of an SCA Configuration
      that contributes a number of Bindings. The first Binding describes a web
      service Endpoint of the type <code>binding.ws</code> and the next
      Binding configuration describes the vendor specific <code>acme</code>
      configuration for an RMI Endpoint. Such a vendor specific Binding Type
      can only be used when the Distribution Provider has built-in supports
      for this hypothetical type.</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;sca:binding.ws

      <para>A Distribution Provider that supports one or more Binding Types
      like <code>sca:binding.ws</code> or <code>acme:binding.rmi</code> must
      uses the rules described in <xref linkend="i3092979"/> to decide whether
      or not to create an Endpoint for any services that reference the
      Bindings. A Binding can be referred to either through its
      <code>NCName</code> or <code>QName</code>, see <xref
      linkend="i3112147"/>. In the previous example, The <code>FooWS</code>
      Binding value is using a short <code>NCName</code>, the
      <code>{http://acme.com/defs}FooRMI</code> Binding uses the longer
      <code>QName</code>. The <code>QName</code> form is more verbose but
      reduces the risk of name clashes. A Distribution Provider must support
      matching both forms.</para>

      <para>If an <code>NCName</code> can be matched against multiple bindings
      then this is considered an error. Such an error should be logged if a
      Log Service is available. This error does not affect the use of other
      bindings listed in the <code>org.osgi.sca.bindings</code>
      property.</para>

    <title>SCA Configuration Document</title>

    <para>An SCA Configuration Document defines the Bindings, Policy Sets and

    <section xml:id="i3113000">
      <title>XML</title>

      <para>In the following sections, the XML is explained using the normal
      regular expression based syntax notation used for headers. There is,
      however, one addition to the normal usage specific to XML, and that is
      the use of the angled brackets <code>( &lt;&gt;)</code>. A term enclosed
      in angled brackets, indicates the use of an actual element, similar to a
      literal. Without the angled brackets it is the definition of a term that
      is expanded later to a one or more other terms or elements. For
      example:</para>

      <programlisting>people     ::= &lt;person&gt; *
person     ::= &lt;child&gt;* address
address    ::= &lt;fr&gt; | &lt;us&gt; | &lt;nl&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>This example uses <code>&lt;person&gt;</code> as a literal for the
      <code>person</code> element and <code>address</code> as a term that is
      defined later. The following XML is an instance of the previous example
      definition:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;people&gt;
    &lt;person id="mieke"&gt;
        &lt;child name="mischa"/&gt;
        &lt;child name="thomas"/&gt;
        &lt;fr zip="34160"/&gt;
    &lt;/person&gt;
&lt;/people&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Attributes are described in tables or in text. The following
      sections are a normative description of the semantics of the schema.
      However, the structure information is illustrative. The actual XML
      Schema is defined in <xref linkend="i3091466"/>.</para>

      <para>The reason many attributes that refer to other elements are typed
      with <code>xsd:string</code> and not <code>QName</code> or
      <code>NCName</code> is done to align the schema with its source, the SCA
      Schema. In SCA, these attributes can contain XPath expressions and must
      therefore be strings. This specifications only supports
      <code>QName</code> and <code>NCName</code> though.</para>

      <para>A number of attributes contain <emphasis>XPath
      expressions</emphasis>. The expressions are ran against a virtual XML
      tree that has an top element with an undefined name and contains all the
      binding elements of the internal registry. For example, the XPath
      expression <code>//sca:binding.ws</code> is guaranteed to select all web
      service bindings in the internal registry.</para>

      <para>The <code>@</code> sign is used to indicate an XML attribute. An
      XML type for an attribute can be suffixed with a plus sign (<code>'+'
      \u002B</code>). This indicates a list of whitespace separated
      elements.</para>

      <title>intent Element</title>

      <para>The <code>intent</code> element defines an Intent. Its structure
      is:</para>

      <programlisting>intent ::= &lt;qualifier&gt; *</programlisting>

      <para>Intents contributed in an <code>intent</code> element must become
      part of the Distribution Provider's Intent vocabulary once they are
      complete, see <xref linkend="i3106449"/>. This includes the Intent name
      itself as well as all its defined qualified variations. These Intent
      names must include the <code>NCName</code> form, allowing the occurrence
      of duplicates.</para>

      <para>The Distribution Provider is responsible for ensuring its Intent
      vocabulary reflects the Intents it is configured to support. For
      example, if an SCA Configuration Bundle with a Policy Set that provides
      the <code>confidentiality</code> Intent is uninstalled, and there are no
      other implementations of that Intent available, then it must be removed
      from the Distribution Provider's Intent vocabulary. Intents can apply to
      specific binding types only. It is therefore possible that an Intent is
      part of a Distribution Provider's vocabulary but is not available for a
      specific Binding Instance.</para>

      <para>The details of how Intents are defined is described in the <xref
      linkend="i3072399"/>. This OSGi Specification only uses the
      <code>constrains</code> attribute for all, or specific Binding Types,
      such as the Binding Type <code>sca:binding.ws</code>. A Distribution
      Provider can choose to support other <code>constrains</code> attribute
      values. If a Distribution Provider encounters a value it does not
      understand then it must not use any of the information defined in the
      offending SCA Configuration Bundle.</para>

      <para>An <code>intent</code> element can have a number of
      <emphasis>qualifiers</emphasis>. This allows the specification of
      qualified Intents The <code>qualifier</code> element is explained in
      <xref linkend="i3094487"/>. The <code>intent</code> element structure is
      illustrated in <xref linkend="i3093935"/>.</para>

      Intent is in the <code>acme</code> namespace because of the

      <para>The <code>qualifier</code> element allows an <code>intent</code>
      element to have qualifiers. An <code>intent</code> element can contain
      any number of <code>qualifier</code> elements, each

      These qualifiers are used to make an Intent more specific. For example,

      an <code>intent@name</code> of <code>confidentiality</code> and a
      qualifier with the name set to <code>message</code>. One, and only one,

      the completeness of an exported service or imported Endpoint changes
      over time. The Distribution Provider must ensure that the configuration

    <title>SCA and Remote Service Admin</title>

    <para>The <xref linkend="service.remoteserviceadmin"/> provides an API for
    the Distribution Provider; it enables a topology manager to import and
    export services. A discovery mechanism is also provided to discover
    <emphasis>Endpoint Descriptions</emphasis> through different protocols.
    Endpoint Descriptions are property based and provide the details for a
    specific Endpoint. Using these properties it must be possible to create a
    connection to the corresponding Endpoint and import a service, if the used
    configuration type is recognized. The Endpoint Description properties are
    typically set by the Remote Service Admin that created the Endpoint and
    describe the Endpoint details to importers of that Endpoint.</para>

    <para>The Endpoint Description is therefore extensible for different
    configuration types. This section describes the mapping of the SCA
    Configuration Type into the Endpoint Description. This mapping must be
    used by any Remote Service Admin that supports the SCA Configuration Type.
    The properties and values specified here are in addition to those defined
    in the <xref linkend="service.remoteserviceadmin"/>.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Configuration</title>

      <para>An Endpoint Description is moved between systems and can therefore
      not refer to an internal registry. However, the SCA Configuration Type
      allows scoped configurations, see, see <xref linkend="i3114900"/>.
      Scoped configurations allow the Endpoint Description to describe all the
      necessary Bindings, Policy Sets, and Intents.</para>

      <para>Scoped configuration can be provided through:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><code>org.osgi.sca.configs.url</code> - A URL to an SCA
          Configuration Document. This URL must be accessible by an importing
          framework.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><code>org.osgi.sca.config.xml</code> - Embedded XML contained
          in the property. The embedded XML is supported with the
          <code>String</code> data type for properties and using an
          <code>xml</code> element to define it.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>When a Remote Service Admin service creates an Endpoint
      Description it must ensure that at least a complete SCA Configuration
      for that Endpoint is included in that Endpoint Description as either a
      URL or embedded XML.</para>

      <para>A Remote Service Admin must recognize the scoped configuration in

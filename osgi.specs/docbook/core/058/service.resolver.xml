    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Today very few applications are self contained, the predominant
    development model is that applications are built from (external)
    components, which are often open source. Application developers add
    business logic, glue code, and assemble the diverse components into a
    resource that provides the desired capabilities when installed in an
    environment. Designing the assembly has long been a manual and error prone
    process, partly due to the complexity of external dependencies. Although
    the direct dependencies are often given, the largest number of
    dependencies are usually the transitive dependencies: the dependencies of
    the dependencies. Modern applications can end up with hundreds to
    thousands of external dependencies. Numbers that make tooling
    inevitable.</para>

    <para>The OSGi framework is the first specification that provides a
    foundation for automating a significant part of this assembly process. The
    Requirement-Capability model defined in <xref
    linkend="framework.resource"/> provides a dependency model that allows
    resources to express dependencies, constraints, and capabilities. If a
    resource's constraints are met it provides capabilities that can satisfy
    further requirements. The OSGi dependency model is fully generic and is
    not limited to bundles. Resources can be bundles but also certificates,
    plugged in devices, etc.</para>

    <para>Resolving transitive dependencies is a non-trivial process that
    requires careful design to achieve the required performance since the
    underlying problem is NP-complete. OSGi frameworks have always included
    such resolvers but these were built into the frameworks. They were not
    usable outside the framework for tooling, for example automatically
    finding the dependencies of a bundle that needs to be installed.</para>

    <para>The number of dependencies is rapidly reaching a threshold where
    manual methods no longer can provide reliable results. This specification
    therefore provides the <emphasis>Resolver service</emphasis>, a service
    that can be the base for provisioning, deployment, build, and diagnostic
    tooling. The service can take a requirement and resolve it to a wiring of
    resources. For example, with cloud computing a new requirement can be
    translated into a new OSGi framework instance being started on a node and
    provisioned with the set of bundles that satisfy the given requirement.
    The OSGi Resolver service is intended be a corner stone of such an
    auto-provisioning tool.</para>

    <para>However, the OSGi Resolver service is not limited to these higher
    end schemes. Build tools can use the Resolver to find components for the
    build path and/or run time environment and predict the results of
    installing a set of bundles on a target environment. The OSGi Resolver
    service is an essential part of a software model where applications are
    built out of independent components.</para>

    <para>This specification is based on the concepts and API defined in the
    <xref linkend="framework.resource"/>, <xref linkend="framework.wiring"/>,
    and the <xref linkend="framework.module"/>. These specifications are
    required reading for understanding this specification. This specification
    is for highly specialized use, it is not intended to be used in
    applications, the Resolver API is a low level service intended for system
    developers with deep knowledge of the OSGi module layer.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Synopsis</title>

      <para>The Resolver service can find a complete and consistent set of
      transitive dependencies starting with an initial set of mandatory and
      optional resources. Such a set can be used to install resources in the
      environment from local or remote repositories. To use the Resolver
      service, the client must provide a <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> object. This complex object represents the
      context of a resolution; it provides the initial resources (optional and
      mandatory), defines a number of namespaces specific policies, and
      provides the state of the environment.</para>

      <para>A resolution can be based on an existing wiring in the
      environment, for example the current framework state. For the framework,
      the Resolve Context can find this existing state via the <xref
      linkend="framework.wiring"/>. The Resolver must then satisfy all the
      requirements of the mandatory resources. The Resolver must always ask
      the Resolve Context to find additional capabilities for the unsatisfied
      requirements. A capability is always associated with a resource, which
      is subsequently associated with additional requirements. The final
      resolution must contain a set of resources that include the initial set
      of mandatory resources, has no unsatisfied mandatory requirements, and
      is consistent with the implied constraints. Otherwise it fails.</para>

      <para>The Requirement-Capability model is fully generic but provides
      special semantics through the use of namespaces. The Resolver must
      implement the standard OSGi namespaces as described in <xref
      linkend="framework.wiring"/>, which includes the <code>uses</code>
      constraints. Part of the semantics of the OSGi namespaces are delegated
      to the Resolve Context so that it can implement different policies.
      Singletons, ordering of capabilities, and matching are the
      responsibility of the Resolve Context; the Resolver never matches a
      requirement to a capability.</para>

      <para>Requirements have an <code>effective</code> directive that
      indicates in what situations the requirement must be resolved. Also
      here, the Resolve Context decides if a particular requirement is
      effective or not. Only effective requirements are wired in the
      resolution.</para>

      <para>Since capabilities are declared by resources that have additional
      requirements, the Resolver must create a set of resources where all
      transitive requirements are satisfied or fail with a Resolution
      Exception. This Resolution Exception can provide additional details why
      the resolution failed, if possible.</para>

      <para>At the end of a successful resolve operation the Resolver returns
      a <code>Map&lt;Resource,List&lt;Wire&gt;&gt;</code>. These wires are a
      delta on the existing state, if any. The wires can then be used to
      provision missing resources or to provide diagnostic feedback.</para>

  <section>
    <title>The Resolve Context</title>

    <para>Provisioning is the process of providing a framework with the
    necessary resources to allow it to operate according to set goals. In OSGi
    terms, this consists of installing bundles and ensuring that the
    configuration is set up correctly. With OSGi, bundles explicitly describe
    their capabilities and requirements as manifest headers. This can range
    from Export-Package (a capability) to a generic Provide-Capability
    header.</para>

    <para>OSGi Frameworks have a <emphasis>resolving</emphasis> stage that
    ensures requirements are satisfied before a bundle is allowed to provide
    code to the shared space. As long as the requirements are not met, the
    bundle remains in the <code>INSTALLED</code> state and is thus prohibited
    from contributing capabilities. Once all the mandatory requirements are
    met, the bundle becomes <code>RESOLVED</code>. That is, a framework
    combines two decisions when it resolves bundles:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Find a resolution based on the existing set of installed
        bundles.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Move the bundles that have all their mandatory requirements
        satisfied to the <code>RESOLVED</code> state.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The <emphasis>Resolver service</emphasis> separates these two stages
    and thus allows a third party, the <emphasis>management agent</emphasis>,
    to define the <emphasis>environment</emphasis> of the resolution. A
    management agent can interact with the Resolver service while it is
    searching for a resolution because the Resolver service calls back the
    management agent through a <xref
    linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext" xrefstyle="hyperlink"/>
    object. The Resolver service will therefore allow the management agent to
    handle more scenarios, better diagnostics, etc.</para>

    <para>The Resolve Context is provided by the management agent, it is an
    abstract base class and must therefore be extended. It is a non-trivial
    class to implement since it is tightly coupled to the rules of the
    environment; it represents the policies of the management agent for that
    environment. For OSGi framework resolvers, the Resolve Context must
    understand and implement a part of the OSGi framework namespaces.</para>

    <para>With the Resolver service, a management agent can try out
    resolutions before any bundle can see the result of such a resolution but
    it can also include extra bundles or other resources on demand. The
    Resolver service will also allow resolutions to be calculated for other
    frameworks.</para>

    <para>For example, a management agent could use a Resolver service to find
    missing dependencies and install them on demand from a local directory
    with bundles. Such a Provisioner could have the following skeleton:</para>

    <programlisting>public class Provisioner {
  File                 bundles   = ...;
  Map&lt;String,Resource&gt; resources = ...;
  Resolver             resolver  = ...;
  BundleContext        context   = ...;

  public void install(String location) {
    Resource resource = resources.get( location );
    if ( resource == null ) error(...);
    
    try {
       ResolveContextImpl rc = ...
       rc.addMandatory( resource );
      Set&lt;Resource&gt; provision = resolver.resolve( rc ).keySet();

      for ( Resource rb : provision ) {
        String location = getLocation( rb );
        
        Bundle bundle = context.installBundle( location );
            if ( !isFragment( bundle ) )
            bundle.start();
      }
    } catch(ResolutionException re) {
      ... // diagnostics
    } catch(BundleException be) {
      ... // diagnostics
    }
  }
}</programlisting>

    <section>
      <title>Mandatory and Optional Resources</title>

      <para>The Resolve Context provides all the parameters for the resolve
      operation, the Resolver does not maintain any state between invocations.
      The Resolve Context must therefore provide the mandatory and optional
      resources, which are essentially the input parameters to the resolve
      operation. The resolver must find a solution that includes at least the
      initial mandatory resources and should include the optional
      resources.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="i3344409">
      <title>Finding Capabilities</title>

      <para>The Resolve Context's <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method must be implemented in such a way that it
      returns an ordered list of capabilities. The Resolver will treat the
      order of the capabilities as preferences, the first element is more
      preferred than a later element. The Resolver cannot guarantee that the
      wiring obeys this preference since there can be other constraints.
      However, a Resolver must use this preference order for simple cases and
      try to use it in more constrained situations.</para>

      <para>The Resolver does not make any assumptions, this means that the
      <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method must do all the matching. Even though the
      Resolver gets the mandatory and optional resources it will not search
      these for capabilities to satisfy requirements. If the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method does not search these resources then
      their capabilities will not be used. The same is true for the existing
      wiring state used.</para>

      <para>Since this section describes the Resolver with respect to a
      provisioning agent, the set of resources is not limited to the installed
      set. That is, normally when a framework is resolved the Resolver only
      has to include installed resources. However, for a provisioning agent it
      is possible to retrieve external resources. The <xref
      linkend="service.resolver-ref.service.repository"/> provides access to
      resource repositories but a management agent is free to find
      capabilities by any alternative means.</para>

      <para>For resolving an OSGi framework the specifications outlines a
      number of heuristics that guide the order of wiring bundles and
      packages:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A resource that is already resolved, that is, it is already
          wired</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The highest version</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The lowest bundle id</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>The Resolver can, and likely will, use the returned list to
      maintain its internal state during the resolve operation while trying
      out different potential solutions. It can add and remove capabilities at
      will. The returned list must therefore be mutable and not reused, after
      it is returned; it becomes owned by the Resolver. However, the Resolver
      can call back later with the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.insertHostedCapability-List-HostedCapability-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method, giving back the returned list as the
      first parameter, see <xref linkend="i3344346"/>.</para>

      <para>For example, assume that all possible resources in the previous
      example can be gotten with the <code>getSortedResources</code> method in
      the preferred resource order. This list contains all installed resources
      as well as any potentially installable resources. This list is sorted
      once on the given ordering criteria, this only has to be done once and
      not for each <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method invocation. The following code, which
      does not order by capability versions, could then be a simple skeleton
      for the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method on the <code>ResolveContextImpl</code>
      inner class:</para>

      <programlisting>public List&lt;Capability&gt; findProviders(Requirement requirement ) {
  List&lt;Capability&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;Capability&gt;();

  for ( Resource r : getSortedResources() )
    for ( Capability c : r.getCapabilities( null ) )
      if ( match( requirement, c ) )
          result.add( c );

  return result;
}</programlisting>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Matching</title>

      <para>The <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method is responsible for only returning the
      capabilities that the management agent wants to be considered by the
      Resolver. Since the Resolver must never match any requirements to
      capabilities it allows the management agent to fully control the
      matching. However, in an OSGi environment the following matching
      behavior is expected:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Requirements and capabilities must be in the same
          namespace.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Only requirements and capabilities that have no
          <code>effective</code> directive or have the directive set to
          <code>resolve</code> should be considered.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The requirement's filter must match the capability's
          attributes.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If the namespace is an <code>osgi.wiring.*</code> namespace
          then the <code>mandatory</code> directive on the capability must be
          supported. Mandatory attributes are defined with a
          <code>mandatory</code> directive on a capability, they contain a
          list of attribute names. Each of these attributes must be used in
          the filter. Since the filter must be constructed from the
          corresponding manifest header it is sufficient to search the filter
          string with a regular expression that detects the usage of an
          attribute name.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The following example shows a skeleton <code>match</code> method
      that provides OSGi semantics:</para>

      <programlisting>boolean match(Requirement r, Capability c){
  if ( !r.getNamespace().equals( c.getNamespace() ) )
    return false;

  String effective = c.getDirectives().get("effective");
  if ( !(effective == null || effective.equals( "resolve") ) ) 
    return false;

  String f = r.getDirectives().get( "filter" );
  if ( f  != null ) {
    Filter filter = context.createFilter( f );
    if ( !filter.matches( c.getAttributes() ) )
      return false;
  }

  if ( !c.getNamespace().startsWith( "osgi.wiring." ) )
    return true;

  String mandatory = c.getDirectives().get("mandatory");
  if ( mandatory == null)
    return true;

  List&lt;String&gt; attrs = 
    Arrays.asList( mandatory.toLowerCase().split( "\\s*,\\s*") );

  Matcher m = FILTER_ASSERT_PATTERN.matcher( f == null ? "": f );
  while( m.find() )
    attrs.remove(m.group(1)); // the attribute name

  return mandatory.isEmpty();
}</programlisting>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Repositories</title>

      <para>Resolving to provision a framework is different than a framework
      resolving itself. During provisioning remote repositories can be
      consulted to find external resources while the framework only resolves a
      limited set (the installed bundles). These repositories generally
      contain magnitudes more bundles than what is installed in a
      framework.</para>

      <para>Repositories do not implement any namespace specific semantics and
      therefore do not understand any directives. Repositories only verify the
      requirement's filter (if any) against the capability's attributes. The
      Resolver expects the Resolve Context to do the namespace specific
      matching. The <xref linkend="service.resolver-ref.service.repository"/>
      provides the details for a service that abstracts a
      Requirement-Capability aware repository.</para>

      <para>With such a repository service the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method can be implemented as follows:</para>

      <programlisting>List&lt;Repository&gt; repositories = new CopyOnWriteArrayList&lt;Repository&gt;();

void addRepository(  Repository repository) { repositories.add(repository);}
void removeRepository(Repository repository){ repositories.remove(repository);}

      <title>Existing Wiring State</title>

      <para>The Resolver service always creates a list of wires that should be
      added to an existing state. To get the existing state, the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> interface specifies the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.getWirings--"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method. This method must return the existing
      state as a <code>Map&lt;Resource,Wiring&gt;</code>. A
      <code>Wiring</code> is an object that reflects the wired state of a
      resource in the environment. From this object, all declared and hosted
      capabilities and requirements can be found, including their wires if
      any. The Resolver needs this existing state to create a consistent
      resolution. For example, uses constraints require access to the existing
      state.</para>

      <para>The Resolver service API is based on the generic
      Requirement-Capability model. This API is implemented by the OSGi
      framework to reflect its internal wiring, see <xref
      linkend="framework.wiring"/>. When the Resolver service is used for an
      OSGi framework then the Resolve Context can provide the existing wiring
      state based on the Framework Wiring API. The interfaces used in the
      <code>org.osgi.framework.wiring</code> package all extend their
      counterpart in the <code>org.osgi.resource</code> package (the generic
      model). For example, the <code>BundleCapability</code> interface extends
      the <code>Capability</code> interface.</para>

      <para>The framework wiring API models all the power and complexities of
      the OSGi framework. One of those aspects is <emphasis>removal
      pending</emphasis>. Each installed bundle is represented by one or more
      bundle revisions. Each bundle revision is a <code>Resource</code> object
      but only one is the current bundle revision. During a resolve operation
      a framework can actually wire to the current bundle revision but is not
      forbidden to also select the pending removal bundle revisions. The
      Resolve Context must therefore decide if it provides only the current
      bundle revisions or all. The best policy solution in this case is to
      always refresh after a (batch) of install operations and only resolve
      when there are no pending-removal bundle revisions. However, certain
      management agents attempt to manage a system that is in this half-way
      state and will then be required to include the pending-removal
      revisions.</para>

      <para>The following example code shows a possible implementation of the
      <xref linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.getWirings--"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method. It only uses the current wiring and
      ignores removal pending bundle revisions:</para>

      <programlisting>public Map&lt;Resource,Wiring&gt; getWirings(){
    Map&lt;Resource,Wiring&gt; wirings = new HashMap&lt;Resource,Wiring&gt;();

   for ( Bundle b : context.getBundles() ) {
     BundleRevision revision = b.adapt( BundleRevision.class);
     if ( revision != null ) {
       Wiring wiring = revision.getWiring();
       if ( wiring != null )
           wirings.put( revision, wiring );
     }
   }
   return wirings;
}</programlisting>

      <para>A wiring for a resource may also have a subset of required wires
      which substitute capabilities provided by the resource or one of its
      attached fragment resources. The <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.getSubstitutionWires-Wiring-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method is called by the resolver in order to
      find the wires that substitute capabilities of the wiring. For example,
      when a wiring provides a <code>osgi.wiring.bundle</code> capability that
      is used to resolve one or more <code>osgi.wiring.bundle</code>
      requirements. In this case the resolver needs to discover which
      capabilities have been substituted in order to ensure a consistent class
      space (see <xref linkend="framework.module.requiringbundles"/>). In
      order to get the capabilities which have been substituted, the resolver
      asks the resolve context to return the substitution wires for the
      wiring.</para>

      <para>Note that the default implementation of this method searches all
      the <code>osgi.wiring.package</code> capabilities which are declared as
      provided by the resource associated with the wiring and fragment
      resources wired to the wiring with the <code>osgi.wiring.host</code>
      namespace. The provided capabilities are compared against the required
      package wires to determine which wires are substitution wires.
      Subclasses of ResolveContext should provide a more efficient
      implementation of this method.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Effective</title>

      <para>The Resolver service is designed to work with OSGi frameworks but
      the scope is broader; its design allows many alternative usages. The
      <code>effective</code> directive on the capabilities and requirements is
      meant to allow requirements and capabilities to be effective in
      different phases. The default is <code>resolve</code>, the value for an
      OSGi framework resolving process. Bundles and other OSGi defined
      artifacts must declare their capabilities and requirements in the
      <code>resolve</code> effective time to be considered by an OSGi
      resolver.</para>

      <para>However, Resolvers can use the <code>effective</code> directive to
      run the Resolver at other times than the standard OSGi framework
      resolve. For example, the widely adopted convention <code>active</code> 
      (defined in <code>org.osgi.resource.Namespace.EFFECTIVE_ACTIVE</code>) can 
      be used to resolve runtime service dependencies. As described in 
      <xref linkend="framework.resource"/>, the <code>active</code> effective 
      time is a convention that enables tooling to distinguish between compile-time 
      and runtime dependencies, but it is not processed by the OSGi Framework's 
      standard resolve operation.</para>

      <para>For this reason, the Resolver is designed to be agnostic for this
      directive, it will always ask the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> if a requirement is effective. It does this with
      the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.isEffective-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method. Since the Resolver service never matches
      requirements to capabilities it is also up to the Resolve Context to
      decide how to treat the <code>effective</code> directive. For an OSGi
      resolve operation, capabilities should also have an effective time value
      of <code>resolve</code> (or not set since <code>resolve</code> is the
      default).</para>

      <para>To make requirements effective during the resolving of bundles it
      will be necessary to implement the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.isEffective-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method similar to:</para>

      <programlisting>public boolean isEffective( Requirement requirement) {
  String e = requirement.getDirectives().get( "effective");
  return e==null || "resolve".equals( e );
}</programlisting>

      <para>To resolve requirements with <code>effective:=active</code>, 
      the Resolve Context implementation would need to return <code>true</code> 
      from <code>isEffective</code> for such requirements. This allows build and 
      provisioning tools to perform custom resolution operations beyond the OSGi 
      Framework's standard resolve behavior.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="i3344346">
      <title>Insert Hosted Capabilities</title>

      <para>One of the complex aspects of resolving for an OSGi framework is
      handling fragments. For fragments, the declared capabilities are going
      to be hosted by their hosts. The <code>Requirement</code> and
      <code>Capability</code> objects have a <code>getResource</code> method
      that returns the associated resource. For hosted capabilities and
      requirements this must be the hosting resource and for others the
      declaring resource.</para>

      <para>The <xref linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.HostedCapability"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> interface defines the interface for allowing the
      hosting resource to be returned instead of the declaring resource. Since
      the Resolver service creates these Hosted Capabilities the Resolver
      needs a way to add them to the lists of capabilities returned from <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/>. The Resolver service cannot add them itself
      since this list has a preference order, the Resolver service must
      therefore ask the Resolve Context to insert this new capability to allow
      the Resolve Context to maintain the desired order.</para>

      <para>The Resolve Context must therefore implement an <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.insertHostedCapability-List-HostedCapability-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method. The given list must have been returned
      earlier from a <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method invocation. The Resolve Context must find
      the appropriate position to insert the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.HostedCapability"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> object, insert it, and return the index of the
      inserted object.</para>

      <para>It is the responsibility of the Resolve Context to find the proper
      position. In <xref linkend="i3344409"/> it was discussed how the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method must return an ordered list. The <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.insertHostedCapability-List-HostedCapability-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> has that same responsibility.</para>

      <para>The following example shows how the Hosted Capability is inserted
      based on the index of the hosted resource's index in the sorted list of
      resources the management agent maintained. The example iterates through
      the capabilities and compares the index of sorted resources to indicate
      preference. If it finds a capability from a resource that was later in
      the list of sorted resources then it inserts it at that position. A real
      implementation should also take the version of the capability into
      account.</para>

      <programlisting>public int insertHostedCapability( 
    List&lt;Capability&gt; caps, HostedCapability hc ) {

    List&lt;Resource&gt; resources = getSortedResources();
    int index = resources.indexOf( hc.getResource() );

    for ( int i =0; i &lt; caps.size(); i++ ) {
        Capability c = caps.get( i );
        int otherIndex = resources.indexOf( c.getResource() );
        if ( otherIndex &gt; index ) {
            caps.add( i, hc );
            return i;
        }
    }
    caps.add( hc );
    return caps.size()-1;
}</programlisting>

    <section xml:id="i3347565">
      <title>Fragments</title>

      <para>Fragments are resources that have an <code>osgi.wiring.host</code>
      requirement that must match a capability from one or more host bundles.
      However, for example an Export-Package in a fragment must be merged with
      its attached hosts. These capabilities and requirements from namespaces
      that appear as if they come from the host bundle are called
      <emphasis>hosted</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>When resolving a set of resources it must be possible to pull in
      any available fragments which may attach to the resource. Since
      fragments are not required by the host bundle, there will be no resource
      requiring the fragment bundles. However, fragments will require their
      hosts. A Resolver should attach any fragments available in a resolution
      to suitable hosts.</para>

      <para>In order to discover additional fragments which may be attached to
      the resources in a resolution the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findRelatedResources-Resource-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method is called by the resolver . The resolver
      attempts to also resolve the related resources during the current
      resolve operation. Failing to resolve one of the related resources must
      not result in a resolution exception unless the related resource is also
      considered a mandatory resource.</para>

      <para>A resolve context may consider a fragment to be a related resource
      for the hosts it can attach to. In order for the resolver to pull the
      fragments into the resolve operation the resolve context is asked to
      return the related resources of each host bundle which is to be
      resolved. The resolve context may decide if the fragments of the host
      needs to be resolved along with the host. Note that fragments are used
      as an example of a related resource. The resolve context is free to use
      any type of resource as a related resource.</para>

      <para>Fragments can of course also be found by the normal finding of
      capabilities.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Singleton Capabilities</title>

      <para>A resource can be marked as a <emphasis>singleton</emphasis>. A
      singleton resource has the <code>singleton</code> directive set to true
      on the <code>osgi.identity</code> capability. A singleton resource
      <emphasis>conflicts</emphasis> with another singleton resource
      if:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>They have the same <code>osgi.identity</code>, and</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>They have the same <code>type</code>, and</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>They have a different or identical version.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>This constraint is not enforced by the Resolver service to give
      more flexibility to management agents. The Resolve Context must ensure
      that it does not return capabilities from conflicting singleton
      resources from the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method. When the Resolver is used with a limited
      set of resources then it is possible to enumerate all singletons ahead
      of time and use permutations. However, when repositories are used an
      incremental method works better because the scope is so much
      larger.</para>

      <para>When the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method is called for a requirement that selects
      a capability declared in a singleton then it is likely that repositories
      will return multiple versions of this singleton including the resource
      with the highest available version for conflicting resources. It is
      therefore possible to maintain a white list of singletons
      incrementally.</para>

      <para>Once the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method has created a result list, it is possible
      to prune this list of conflicting singletons. This can be an incremental
      process, the first time a singleton is encountered in such a list of
      capabilities the highest version can be <emphasis>selected</emphasis> as
      the singleton. Other singletons that are in that list or come in other
      invocations of <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> can then no longer provide capabilities. For
      example:</para>

      <programlisting>    Map&lt;String,Resource&gt; allowlist = new HashMap&lt;String,Resource&gt;();

    void prune( List&lt;Capability&gt; list ) {
        Map&lt;String,Resource&gt; singletons = new HashMap&lt;String,Resource&gt;();

        for ( Capability c : list) {
            Resource r = c.getResource();
            Version now = getVersion( r );
            String identity = getIdentity( r );

                if ( selected == null )
                    singletons.put( identity, r );
                else {
                    Version old = getVersion( selected );

                }
            }
      }

      this.allowlist.putAll( singletons );

        for ( Iterator&lt;Capability&gt; i=list.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {
            Capability c = i.next();
            Resource r = c.getResource();
            String identity = getIdentity( r );
            Resource selected = this.allowlist.get( identity );
            if ( selected != null &amp;&amp; !selected.equals( r ))

      <para>The Resolver service throws a <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolutionException"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> when the <code>resolve</code> operation cannot
      find a solution. This Exception provides the standard human readable
      message. However, there is also the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolutionException.getUnresolvedRequirements--"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method. With this method it is possible to find
      what requirements could not be matched. Though this is very useful in
      many cases it must be realized that resolving is a complicated process.
      It is not possible to establish the exact set of missing requirements
      because any unresolved resolution can have many, different, sets of
      unresolved requirements. This is an intrinsic part of the resolution
      problem. There is also no guarantee that providing capabilities that
      satisfy these requirements will give a successful resolution. There
      could still be other constraints that cannot be satisfied. In general,
      the Resolve Context can already detect any unresolved mandatory
      requirements when it cannot find a matching capability in the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method.</para>

      <para>That said, the <xref

      <title>Cancel</title>

      <para>Some resolution operations can be long running, and therefore a
      resolve context may want to cancel the currently running resolve
      operation. The resolver must register a single runnable callback with
      the resolve context that is associated with the currently running
      resolve operation. The <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.onCancel-Runnable-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method must be invoked by the resolver
      implementation before any other method on the resolve context is
      invoked. The resolve context invokes the callback to cancel the
      currently running resolve operation that appears to be running endlessly
      or at risk of running out of resources. The resolve context may give up
      on the resolve operation or attempt to try another resolve operation
      with a smaller set of resources which may allow the resolve operation to
      complete normally.</para>

    <title>Resolver Service</title>

    <para>The <emphasis>Resolver</emphasis> service is an interface to a

    <para>The task of the Resolver is to find a

      the framework's resolving process.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Resolving</title>

      <para>The goal of the Resolver is to provide a set of wires between a
      set of <emphasis>resolved</emphasis> resources. A resource is resolved
      when all its <emphasis>mandatory</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>effective</emphasis> requirements are satisfied by
      capabilities from resolved resources. A Resolver must not return wires
      between resources that have unsatisfied mandatory requirements.</para>

      <para>A <emphasis>mandatory</emphasis> requirement has a
      <code>resolution</code> directive that is not set or that is set to
      <code>mandatory</code>. The <emphasis>effectiveness</emphasis> of a
      requirement is defined by the Resolve Context, a Resolver service must
      call the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.isEffective-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method to establish if a requirement is
      effective for a given resolve operation. A Resolver must never create a
      wire from a requirement that is not effective.</para>

      <para>To find a resolution, the Resolver must use the Resolve Context to
      find <emphasis>candidate</emphasis> capabilities for the requirements
      declared in the resources that it needs to resolve. A candidate
      capability is a capability that <emphasis>satisfies</emphasis> the
      requirement. From the perspective of the Resolver service, a requirement
      is satisfied by a capability when that capability is returned from the
      <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method. A Resolver has no alternative way to
      find out if a requirement is satisfied by a capability and must
      therefore not make any assumptions about matching. Any matching rules
      like for example the <code>osgi.wiring.*</code> <code>mandatory</code>
      directive must be implemented by the Resolve Context. A Resolve Context
      must always return the same capabilities during a resolving operation
      when given the same requirement.</para>

      <para>Since the resolver cannot match requirements and capabilities the
      Resolve Context must return capabilities for all possible resources,
      this must include:</para>

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>It can include additional resources that were indirectly returned
      through the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method.</para>

      <para>The existing wiring X and its substitution wires S provides an
      existing set of constraints that the Resolver service must abide by. It
      can get this state with the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.getWirings--"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> and <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.getSubstitutionWires-Wiring-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> methods. The purpose of the existing state is to
      ensure that any wires are compatible with existing wiring. For an OSGi
      framework it is crucial that the uses constraints are maintained for the
      resolution, see <xref linkend="framework.module"/>.</para>

      <para>The Resolver service can wire new requirements to existing
      capabilities but it can never create wires for an existing requirement
      from the existing wiring unless the resolve process is for a dynamic
      resolve, see <xref linkend="i3347566"/>.</para>

      <para>If the Resolver service attaches a hosted resource like a
      fragment, and thereby needs to add new <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.HostedCapability"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> objects to a previously returned list from <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> then it must call the Resolve Context's <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.insertHostedCapability-List-HostedCapability-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method.</para>

      <para>Fragments can be attached to resolved resources or to resources
      that declare the capabilities returned from <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/>, that is,
      <emphasis>C</emphasis><subscript>env</subscript>. Additional resources
      are also pulled into the resolve operation by invoking the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findRelatedResources-Resource-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method on the resolve context. As part of the
      related resources the resolve context can include fragments to be
      considered as part of the resolve operation. This allows the available
      fragments to be resolved when the host is being resolved.</para>

      <para>This specification does not define the detailed rules and
      constraints associated with resolving; these rules are defined in their
      namespaces. An OSGi Resolver service must support at least all
      namespaces defined in <xref linkend="framework.namespaces"/> except for
      the following directives:</para>

      <title>Dynamic Resolving</title>

      <para>The <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.Resolver.resolveDynamic-ResolveContext-Wiring-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method is used to resolve a dynamic requirement
      for an existing host wiring. For example, this method can be used to
      resolve dynamic package imports as specified by the
      <code>DynamicImport-Package</code> manifest header. This method may
      resolve additional resources in order to resolve the dynamic
      requirement. Dynamic resolving must return a resolution <code>D</code>
      that is a delta on the existing Wiring state <code>X</code> or throw a
      <xref linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolutionException"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> if the dynamic requirement cannot be
      resolved.</para>

      <para>The delta must contain the host resource of the host wiring as a
      key. The list of wires for the host resource entry will contain a single
      wire that resolves the dynamic requirement to a valid capability. The
      delta wiring may also contain additional resources that are necessary to
      resolve the dynamic requirement.</para>

      <para>To find a dynamic resolution <code>D</code>, the Resolver must use
      the Resolve Context in the same way as normal resolving except the
      Resolve Context is not asked for mandatory or optional resources as
      provided by <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.getMandatoryResources--"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> and <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.getOptionalResources--"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/>. The Resolve Context is asked to find providers
      for the dynamic requirement as provided by <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/>.</para>

      <para>The Resolver assumes the following about the host wiring and the
      dynamic requirement:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The requirement uses the <code>osgi.wiring.package</code>
          namespace.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The requirement has a <code>resolution</code> directive of
          <code>dynamic</code>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The requirement is hosted by the host wiring.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A requirement that has a <code>cardinality</code> directive of
          <code>single</code> is not used by an existing required wire of the
          host wiring.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The Resolver is not required to validate these assumptions. If
      these assumptions are not true then the result of the dynamic resolution
      is not specified.</para>

      <para>The Resolver uses the dynamic requirement to call <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolveContext.findProviders-Requirement-"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> in order to find valid matching capabilities. In
      order for a matching capability to be considered as valid it must
      satisfy the following rules:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The capability must use the <code>osgi.wiring.package</code>
          namespace.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The wiring must not provide an
          <code>osgi.wiring.package</code> capability that has the same
          package name as the matching capability. In other words, the
          resolved bundle must not already export the package name.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The wiring must not have a required wire that wires to an
          <code>osgi.wiring.package</code> capability that has the same
          package name as the matching capability. In other words, the
          resolved bundle must not already import the package name.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The Resolver assumes the matching capabilities are valid. If
      invalid capabilities are returned by the Resolve Context then the result
      of the dynamic resolution is not specified.</para>

      <para>At this point the dynamic resolution continues on as a normal
      resolution where the host wiring resource is considered a mandatory
      resource and the dynamic requirement is considered a mandatory
      requirement. The resources providing the matching capabilities to the
      dynamic requirement are then resolved as in a normal resolution
      operation.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Resolution Exception</title>

      <para>If the Resolver cannot find a solution or it runs into problems
      then it must throw a Resolution Exception, which is a Runtime
      Exception.</para>

      <para>The <xref linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolutionException"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> provides the <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolutionException.getUnresolvedRequirements--"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> method. If the resolution failed then it is
      possible that this was caused because it failed to find matches for
      certain requirements. The information in this method can be very helpful
      to find a solution that will work, however, there are a number of
      caveats.</para>

      <para>Resolving is an NP-complete problem. For these problems there
      exists no algorithm that can infer a solution from the desired outcome.
      Therefore, the Resolver tries a potential solution and if that solution
      does not match the constraints it will backtrack and attempt another
      solution. An unavoidable aspect of such solutions is that it is
      impossible to pin-point a single failure point if the algorithm fails to
      find a solution, in general the algorithm gives up after having
      exhausted its search space. However, during its search it might have
      been very close to a solution, for example it only missed a single
      requirement, but its final failure missed many requirements.</para>

      <para>The implication is that the reported missing requirements neither
      give a guarantee for a resolution when satisfied nor indicate that this
      is the smallest set of missing requirements.</para>

      <para>Therefore, <xref
      linkend="org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolutionException.getUnresolvedRequirements--"
      xrefstyle="hyperlink"/> is intended for human consumption and not for
      automated solutions.</para>

      <para>The Resolver service is a pure function that has no state. The

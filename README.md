# OSGi

This is the main git repository for the OSGi specifications, implementations and TCKs. It is a Bnd Workspace model build.

## Build

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on checking out the repo and building.

## Draft Specifications

The GitHub Actions build "GitHub Pages" job will publish the draft specifications into the repo's `gh-pages` branch. So you can view the draft specifications for the `osgi/osgi` repo:

- [Core](https://osgi.github.io/osgi/core/)
- [Compendium](https://osgi.github.io/osgi/cmpn/)

In your fork, just add `core/` or `cmpn/` to the end of your fork's GitHub Pages URL. For example:

> https://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/osgi/core/

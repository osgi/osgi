/**
 * An installed bundle in the Framework.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@code Bundle} object is the access point to define the lifecycle of an
 * installed bundle. Each bundle installed in the OSGi environment must have an
 * associated {@code Bundle} object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A bundle must have a unique identity, a {@code long}, chosen by the
 * Framework. This identity must not change during the lifecycle of a bundle,
 * even when the bundle is updated. Uninstalling and then reinstalling the
 * bundle must create a new unique identity.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A bundle can be in one of six states:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #UNINSTALLED}</li>
 * <li>{@link #INSTALLED}</li>
 * <li>{@link #RESOLVED}</li>
 * <li>{@link #STARTING}</li>
 * <li>{@link #STOPPING}</li>
 * <li>{@link #ACTIVE}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Values assigned to these states have no specified ordering; they represent
 * bit values that may be ORed together to determine if a bundle is in one of
 * the valid states.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A bundle should only have active threads of execution when its state is one
 * of {@code STARTING},{@code ACTIVE}, or {@code STOPPING}. An
 * {@code UNINSTALLED} bundle can not be set to another state; it is a zombie
 * and can only be reached because references are kept somewhere.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Framework is the only entity that is allowed to create {@code Bundle}
 * objects, and these objects are only valid within the Framework that created
 * them.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Bundles have a natural ordering such that if two {@code Bundle}s have the
 * same {@link #getBundleId() bundle id} they are equal. A {@code Bundle} is
 * less than another {@code Bundle} if it has a lower {@link #getBundleId()
 * bundle id} and is greater if it has a higher bundle id.

/**
 * A type implemented by, or extended by, the Provider Role.
 * <p>
 * A non-binary-compatible change to a provider type normally requires
 * incrementing the major version of the type's package. This change will
 * require all providers and all consumers to be updated to handle the change.
 * However, a non-binary-compatible change affecting a {@code protected} access
 * member only requires incrementing the minor version of the type's package.
 * This change will require all providers to be updated to handle the change,
 * but consumers will not require changes since they only use, and do not
 * extend, the provider type and thus could not access {@code protected} access
 * members of the provider type.
 * <p>
 * A binary-compatible change to a provider type normally requires incrementing
 * the minor version of the type's package. This change will require all
 * providers to be updated to handle the change, but consumers will not require
 * changes since they only use, and do not implement or extend, the provider
 * type.
 * <p>
 * A type can be marked {@link ConsumerType} or {@link ProviderType} but not
 * both. A type is assumed to be {@link ConsumerType} if it is not marked either
 * {@link ConsumerType} or {@link ProviderType}.
 * <p>
 * A package can be marked {@link ProviderType}. In this case, all types in the
 * package are considered to be a provider type regardless of whether they are
 * marked {@link ConsumerType} or {@link ProviderType}.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is not retained at runtime. It is for use by tools to
 * understand the semantic version of a package. When a bundle implements a
 * provider type from an imported package, then the bundle's import range for
 * that package must require the package's exact major and minor version.

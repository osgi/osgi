/**
 * Helper service for a servlet context used by a Http Whiteboard implementation
 * to serve HTTP requests.
 * <p>
 * This service defines methods that the Http Whiteboard implementation may call
 * to get information for a request when dealing with whiteboard services.
 * <p>
 * Each {@code ServletContextHelper} is registered with a
 * {@link HttpWhiteboardConstants#HTTP_WHITEBOARD_CONTEXT_NAME
 * "osgi.http.whiteboard.context.name"} service property containing a name to
 * reference by servlets, servlet filters, resources, and listeners. If there is
 * more than one {@code ServletContextHelper} registered with the same context
 * name, the one that is first in the
 * {@link org.osgi.framework.ServiceReference#compareTo(Object) ranking order}
 * is active, the others are inactive.
 * <p>
 * A context is registered with the
 * {@link HttpWhiteboardConstants#HTTP_WHITEBOARD_CONTEXT_PATH
 * "osgi.http.whiteboard.context.path"} service property to define a path under
 * which all services registered with this context are reachable. If there is
 * more than one {@code ServletContextHelper} registered with the same path,
 * each duplicate context path is searched in
 * {@link org.osgi.framework.ServiceReference#compareTo(Object) ranking order}
 * until a matching servlet or resource is found.
 * <p>
 * Servlets, servlet filters, resources, and listeners services may be
 * associated with a {@code ServletContextHelper} service with the
 * {@link HttpWhiteboardConstants#HTTP_WHITEBOARD_CONTEXT_SELECT
 * "osgi.http.whiteboard.context.select"} service property. If the referenced
 * {@code ServletContextHelper} service does not exist or is currently not
 * active, the whiteboard services for that {@code ServletContextHelper} are not
 * active either.
 * <p>
 * If no {@code ServletContextHelper} service is associated, that is no
 * {@link HttpWhiteboardConstants#HTTP_WHITEBOARD_CONTEXT_SELECT
 * "osgi.http.whiteboard.context.select"} service property is configured for a
 * whiteboard service, a default {@code ServletContextHelper} is used.
 * <p>
 * Those whiteboard services that are associated with the same
 * {@code ServletContextHelper} object will share the same
 * {@code ServletContext} object.
 * <p>
 * The behavior of the methods on the default {@code ServletContextHelper} is
 * defined as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getMimeType(String) getMimeType} - Always returns
 * {@code null}.</li>
 * <li>{@link #handleSecurity(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse)
 * handleSecurity} - Always returns {@code true}.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getResource(String) getResource} - Assumes the named resource is
 * in the bundle of the whiteboard service, addressed from the root. This method
 * calls the whiteboard service bundle's {@code Bundle.getEntry} method, and
 * returns the appropriate URL to access the resource. On a Java runtime
 * environment that supports permissions, the Http Whiteboard implementation
 * needs to be granted
 * {@code org.osgi.framework.AdminPermission[*,RESOURCE]}.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getResourcePaths(String) getResourcePaths} - Assumes that the
 * resources are in the bundle of the whiteboard service. This method calls
 * {@code Bundle.findEntries} method, and returns the found entries. On a Java
 * runtime environment that supports permissions, the Http Whiteboard
 * implementation needs to be granted
 * {@code org.osgi.framework.AdminPermission[*,RESOURCE]}.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getRealPath(String) getRealPath} - Always returns
 * {@code null}.</li>
 * </ul>

	 * secure protocol, then this method should set the status in the response
	 * object to Forbidden(403) and return {@code false}.
	 * <p>
	 * When this method returns {@code false}, the Http Whiteboard
	 * implementation will send the response back to the client, thereby
	 * completing the request. When this method returns {@code true}, the Http
	 * Whiteboard implementation will proceed with servicing the request.
	 * <p>
	 * If the specified request has been authenticated, this method must set the
	 * {@link #AUTHENTICATION_TYPE} request attribute to the type of
	 * authentication used, and the {@link #REMOTE_USER} request attribute to
	 * the remote user (request attributes are set using the
	 * {@code setAttribute} method on the request). If this method does not
	 * perform any authentication, it must not set these attributes.

	 * {@code Authorization} object obtained from the
	 * {@code org.osgi.service.useradmin.UserAdmin} service.
	 * <p>
	 * The servlet responsible for servicing the specified request determines
	 * the authentication type and remote user by calling the

	 * the request.

/**
 * Services registered as a {@code Preprocessor} using a whiteboard pattern are
 * executed for every request before the dispatching is performed.
 * <p>
 * If there are several services of this type, they are run in
 * {@link org.osgi.framework.ServiceReference#compareTo(Object) ranking order},
 * the one with the highest ranking is used first.
 * <p>
 * The preprocessor is handled in the same way as filters. When a preprocessor
 * is put into service {@link Filter#init(jakarta.servlet.FilterConfig)} is
 * called, when it is not used anymore {@link Filter#destroy()} is called. As
 * these preprocessors are run before dispatching and therefore the targeted
 * servlet context is not known yet,
 * {@link jakarta.servlet.FilterConfig#getServletContext()} returns the servlet
 * context of the backing implementation. The same context is returned by the
 * request object. The context path is the context path of this underlying
 * servlet context. The passed in chain can be used to invoke the next
 * preprocessor in the chain, or if the end of that chain is reached to start
 * dispatching of the request. A preprocessor might decide to terminate the
 * processing and directly generate a response.
 * <p>
 * Service properties with the prefix
 * {@code HttpWhiteboardConstants#HTTP_WHITEBOARD_PREPROCESSOR_INIT_PARAM_PREFIX}
 * are passed as init parameters to this service.

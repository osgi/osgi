/**
 * UPnP Events are mapped and delivered to applications according to the
 * OSGi whiteboard model. An application that wishes to be notified
 * of events generated by a particular UPnP Device registers a
 * service extending this interface.
 * <p>
 * The notification call from the UPnP Service to any <tt>UPnPEventListener</tt>
 * object must be done asynchronous with respect to the originator (in a separate thread).
 * <p>
 * Upon registration of the UPnP Event Listener service with the Framework, the service is notified
 * for each variable which it listens for with an initial event
 * containing the current value of the variable.
 * Subsequent notifications only happen on changes of the value of the
 * variable.
 * <p>
 * A UPnP Event Listener service filter the events it receives. This event set
 * is limited using a standard framework filter expression which is specified
 * when the listener service is registered.
 * <p>
 * The filter is specified in a property named "upnp.filter" and has as a
 * value an object of type <tt>org.osgi.framework.Filter</tt>.
 * <p>
 * When the Filter is evaluated, the folowing keywords are recognized as
 * defined as literal constants in the <tt>UPnPDevice</tt> class.
 * <p>
 * The valid subset of properties for the registration of UPnP Event Listener
 * services are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><tt>UPnPDevice.TYPE</tt> -- Which type of device to listen for events.</li>
 *   <li><tt>UPnPDevice.ID</tt> -- The ID of a specific device to listen for events.</li>
 *   <li><tt>UPnPService.TYPE</tt> -- The type of a specific service to listen for events.</li>
 *   <li><tt>UPnPService.ID</tt> -- The ID of a specific service to listen for events.</li>
